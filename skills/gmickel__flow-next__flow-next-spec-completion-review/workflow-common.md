# Spec Completion Review Workflow — Common

## Philosophy

Spec completion review verifies spec compliance, NOT code quality. impl-review handles code quality per-task. This review catches:
- Requirements that never became tasks (decomposition gaps)
- Requirements partially implemented across tasks (cross-task gaps)
- Scope drift (task marked done without fully addressing spec intent)
- Missing doc updates

## Phase 0: Backend Detection

**Run this first. Do not skip.**

**CRITICAL: flowctl is BUNDLED — NOT installed globally.** `which flowctl` will fail (expected). Always use:

```bash
set -e
FLOWCTL="$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl"
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"

# Priority: --review flag > env > config (flag parsed in SKILL.md)
# Text output is bare backend name for back-compat grep. --json returns full
# resolved spec (backend, spec, model, effort, source).
BACKEND=$($FLOWCTL review-backend)

if [[ "$BACKEND" == "ASK" ]]; then
 echo "Error: No review backend configured."
 echo "Run /flow-next:setup to configure, or pass --review=rp|codex|copilot|none"
 exit 1
fi

echo "Review backend: $BACKEND"
```

**Spec-form env var (optional):** `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND` accepts bare or full spec:

```bash
FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND=codex:gpt-5.5:xhigh $FLOWCTL codex completion-review "$SPEC_ID" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH"
FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND=copilot:claude-opus-4.5 $FLOWCTL copilot completion-review "$SPEC_ID" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH"
# Or pass spec directly:
$FLOWCTL codex completion-review "$SPEC_ID" --spec "codex:gpt-5.5:xhigh" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH"
```

Per-spec `default_review` (set via `flowctl spec set-backend`) overrides env.

**If backend is "none"**: Skip review, inform user, and exit cleanly (no error).

**Then branch to the backend-specific workflow file:**

| `$BACKEND` | Read |
|------------|------|
| `codex` | [workflow-codex.md](workflow-codex.md) |
| `copilot` | [workflow-copilot.md](workflow-copilot.md) |
| `rp` | [workflow-rp.md](workflow-rp.md) |

Only the file for the active backend should enter context. Do not read the other backend files.

## Anti-patterns (all backends)

- **Reviewing yourself** - You coordinate; the backend reviews
- **No receipt** - If REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH is set, you MUST write receipt
- **Ignoring verdict** - Must extract and act on verdict tag
- **Mixing backends** - Stick to one backend for the entire review session
- **Checking code quality** - That's impl-review's job; focus on spec compliance

Backend-specific anti-patterns live in each `workflow-<backend>.md` file.
