# /flow-next:make-pr — phase reference

Per-phase Done-when checklists. The full execution flow lives in [workflow.md](workflow.md); this file is the at-a-glance map.

| Phase | Goal |
|-------|------|
| Phase 0 | Pre-flight — gh ready, spec resolved, base valid, branch ahead, tasks done, no open PR. |
| Phase 1 | Gather inputs — single `flowctl spec export-cognitive-aid` call, parse payload. |
| Phase 1.5 | HTML render lens (opt-in) — PR artifact from payload + diff, narrow commit, body link line. Off/unset/`--dry-run` ⇒ no-op beyond one config read. |
| Phase 2 | Render body — TL;DR, R-ID table, critical changes; decisions, memory, glossary/strategy, open items, where to look. |
| Phase 3 | Mermaid generation — gated triggers, hard caps, fallback prose. |
| Phase 4 | Push + create PR — `git push`, `gh pr create`, draft/ready, dry-run short-circuit, Ralph behavior. |
| Phase 5 | Output + footer — PR URL, breadcrumb, optional `--memory` write. |

## Phase 0: Pre-flight

**Done when:**

- [ ] Ralph context detected (`RALPH=1` if `FLOW_RALPH=1` or `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` set).
- [ ] Autonomous context detected (`AUTONOMOUS=1` if the `mode:autonomous` token was parsed or `FLOW_AUTONOMOUS=1`) — never sets `RALPH`; prompt sites hard-error under `RALPH || AUTONOMOUS`.
- [ ] When `DRY_RUN != 1`: `gh` installed AND `gh auth status --hostname github.com` succeeds. Skipped under `--dry-run` (Phase 4.0 short-circuits before any `gh pr create`, so requiring `gh` to be installed/authed there blocks the documented inspection path on machines / CI jobs that only render the body).
- [ ] `SPEC_ID` resolved (positional arg → branch-match against `.flow/specs/*.json` + `.flow/epics/*.json` `branch_name` → interactive prompt / Ralph-or-autonomous exit 2).
- [ ] `SPEC_ID` validated via `flowctl show <spec-id> --json` (spec exists).
- [ ] `BASE_REF` resolved through cascade (`--base` → `origin/main` → `main` → `origin/master` → `master` → ask / Ralph-or-autonomous exit 2).
- [ ] `BASE_REF` validated via `git rev-parse --verify --quiet`.
- [ ] HEAD resolves; HEAD ≠ BASE; `git merge-base BASE HEAD` succeeds (shared history); `git rev-list --count <merge-base>..HEAD >= 1` (at least one commit since the merge-base — base does NOT need to be an ancestor of HEAD).
- [ ] Tasks-done check (silent when all done / warn + proceed-as-draft interactively and under `--dry-run` / Ralph/autonomous exit 2). No prompt for open tasks.
- [ ] Existing-PR refusal check: `gh pr view --json url,state,number | jq -r 'select(.state == "OPEN") | .url'` returns empty.
- [ ] `PHASE0_CONTEXT` JSON built with spec / base / head / branch / commits_ahead / open_tasks / flags / draft_force.

**Failure modes:**

- gh missing → exit 1 + install instructions (skipped under `--dry-run`).
- gh unauthenticated → exit 1 + `gh auth login` instructions (skipped under `--dry-run`).
- Spec not resolved + Ralph/autonomous → exit 2.
- Base not resolved + Ralph/autonomous → exit 2.
- Base ref invalid → exit 1.
- HEAD == BASE → exit 1.
- HEAD shares no merge-base with BASE (unrelated histories) → exit 1.
- 0 commits since merge-base → exit 1.
- Open tasks + Ralph/autonomous → exit 2.
- OPEN PR exists → exit 1 + `/flow-next:resolve-pr` hint.

---

## Phase 1: Gather inputs

**Done when:**

- [ ] `flowctl spec export-cognitive-aid <SPEC_ID> --base <BASE_REF> --json` returns successfully.
- [ ] Payload parsed into in-memory dict matching the spec's "Architecture & Data Models" schema.
- [ ] All nine input streams accounted for: `spec`, `tasks`, `memory.{decisions,bugs,patterns}`, `glossary.changes`, `strategy.tracks`, `strategy.alignment_block`, `diff.{stat,name_status,log}`, `reviews.{deferred,suppressed_count,unaddressed}`.

---

## Phase 1.5: HTML render lens (opt-in) — PR artifact

**Done when:**

- [ ] `HTML_LENS` gate read via `flowctl config get artifacts.html.enabled --json`; forced `false` when `DRY_RUN == 1` (the §4.0 no-state-change promise holds: no artifact, no commit, no body line).
- [ ] Mode off/unset/`--dry-run`: entire phase skipped — no reference-file load, no `.flow/artifacts/` write, no commit, no artifact-related output. The config read is the only cost.
- [ ] Mode on: disclosure reference (`plugins/flow-next/references/html-artifacts.md`) loaded; `.flow/artifacts/<spec-id>/pr.html` generated at the fixed path per reference §5 — derived from `EXPORT_PAYLOAD` + the real diff (`git diff --stat "$MERGE_BASE"..HEAD`), **never commit messages**; staleness stamp present (head sha at payload-export time vs base).
- [ ] R-ID verification ran: payload-vs-diff mismatches (claimed evidence outside the diff range, uncovered R-IDs, evidence touching no diff files) render as visibly flagged rows (red R-ID cell + `mismatch` chip + reason) — warn-in-artifact, never blocks make-pr.
- [ ] Pre-publish checklist (reference §8) passed incl. self-containment grep → `OK: self-contained`.
- [ ] Link mode follows the ignore status of the EXACT artifact file (`git check-ignore --no-index -q "$ARTIFACT_PATH"` — catches `.flow/artifacts/**`, `*.html`, and exact-path rules the dir-level probe misses; `--no-index` so an already-tracked artifact still honors a later ignore rule): tracked → exactly ONE narrow pathspec commit `chore(flow): pr artifact <spec-id>` (`-- "$ARTIFACT_PATH"`, never `git add -A`), landing before §2.4b's `HEAD_SHA` capture; byte-identical regeneration → no empty commit (blob link already resolves); ignored → `LINK_MODE=local`, no commit.
- [ ] All git steps failure-guarded via `LENS_OK` (skill runs under `set -e` — an unguarded `git add`/`git commit` would abort the run): add/commit failure flips `LENS_OK=false`, never exits the skill.
- [ ] Render-lens body line recorded for §2.1: repo mode → absolute SHA-pinned blob URL + "GitHub renders committed HTML as source — open locally" note; local mode → local-open guidance only; `LENS_OK=false` → no body line. Never a blob link that 404s.
- [ ] NO `lavish-axi` session opened and NO poll — interactive AND autonomous alike (read-only review instrument; no Lavish snippet exists in this skill).
- [ ] Failure path: generation/checklist/stage/commit failure ⇒ `LENS_OK=false`, body line skipped, exactly ONE stderr note (`HTML render lens skipped: <reason>`), phase exits cleanly into Phase 2 — PR creation proceeds. Ralph `PR_URL=<url>` stdout contract + receipts untouched.

**Failure modes:**

- Artifact generation fails → `LENS_OK=false`, stderr note, no body line, PR proceeds (non-fatal by design; step 5 stage/commit never runs).
- Narrow commit fails (e.g. pre-commit hook) → `LENS_OK=false` via the guarded snippet, stderr note, no body line (the blob link would 404), PR proceeds.

---

## Phase 2: Render body

**Header sections — done when:**

- [ ] Body section order locked: H1 title + summary block + TL;DR + R-ID coverage + Critical changes + (Structural changes from .5) + (Decisions / Memory / Glossary-strategy / Open items / Where to look from .4) + footer breadcrumb. Sections never reorder.
- [ ] Title + summary block renders spec id link, branch / base, task counts, R-ID coverage ratio. Optional 2-line natural-language summary derived from `spec.spec_sections.goal_and_context` first paragraph (truncated to ≈240 chars at sentence boundary). Optional fifth blockquote line: the Phase 1.5 render-lens link (blob URL when committed / local-open guidance when gitignored) — absent entirely when the mode is off, under `--dry-run`, or when Phase 1.5 failed.
- [ ] TL;DR renders 3-5 plain-language bullets sourced from `goal_and_context` first sentence + top 5 tasks by churn (their `done_summary` first sentences). Never includes R-IDs. Never quotes raw diff content. Never pads if fewer than 4 substantive changes shipped.
- [ ] R-ID coverage table renders every R-ID from `spec.spec_sections.acceptance_criteria` in spec order (R-ID gaps preserved verbatim — never renumber). Columns exactly: `R-ID | Acceptance criterion | Task | Evidence`. Criterion text truncated to 120 chars + `…`. Task column derives ONLY from `tasks[].satisfies[]` — never inferred from titles or commit messages — and renders as a blob link per workflow.md §2.4b. Evidence column emits an absolute `[\`<sha7>\`](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/commit/<sha40>)` per commit in `tasks[].evidence.commits[]` (§2.4b — NOT bare-relative `../../commit/`). Uncovered → `⚠️ uncovered` + `—` evidence.
- [ ] When `tasks_summary.uncovered_r_ids` is non-empty, table is followed by an italic explanatory sentence: `⚠️ **<N> uncovered acceptance criterion(a):** R<i>, R<j>, R<k>. Reviewer should confirm these are intentional gaps before merge.`
- [ ] Critical changes section renders ≤7 bullets in 5-tier priority order: (1) high-churn from `diff_summary.high_churn_files[]`, (2) cross-module from `diff_summary.cross_module_changes[]`, (3) public-interface from `diff_summary.public_exports_changed[]` with `removed[]` items emitted FIRST within tier 3, (4) security-sensitive from `diff_summary.security_sensitive_paths[]`, (5) behavior-visible matching `commands/`, `routes/`, `pages/`, `app/`, `cli/`, `hooks/`, `bin/`. Hard 7-bullet cap.
- [ ] Limited-churn fallback bullet emitted when `<5` files / `<50` LOC / no module-boundary signal / no public-export signal — Critical changes section never omitted entirely.
- [ ] No-weakening rule honored: every `public_exports_changed[].removed` entry surfaced as "potentially breaking" / `removes \`<sym>\``. NEVER paraphrased as "non-breaking", "internal-only", "minor", or "trivial".
- [ ] No fabricated paths: every `<path>` in body comes from `diff_summary.files[]`. No fabricated symbols: every `<symbol>` from `diff_summary.public_exports_changed[]`. No fabricated SHAs: every `<sha>` from `tasks[].evidence.commits[]`.
- [ ] No raw diff content / code snippets in body — paths, churn, modules only.
- [ ] All 10 hallucination guardrails (workflow.md §2.5) hold: no fabricated paths/symbols/SHAs, no "non-breaking" weakening, no copy-pasted diff content, no inflated scope, no R-ID misattribution, no stale references, no invented "why" reasoning, every claim traces to a payload field.
- [ ] Section-omission rule (workflow.md §2.6) honored: empty content → no heading. Never empty placeholder. (Critical changes is the one exception — limited-churn fallback bullet keeps the heading present.)
- [ ] Abort conditions (workflow.md §2.7) checked before any rendering: empty `goal_and_context` AND every task missing `done_summary` → exit 1; every R-ID uncovered → exit 1. Empty `acceptance_criteria` (zero R-IDs in spec) is NOT an abort — coverage table is omitted, body proceeds with TL;DR + Critical changes pair.

**Context sections — done when:**

- [ ] Decisions made section (workflow.md §2.8): one bullet per `memory_during_spec.decisions[]` entry — `**<title>** ([<id>](https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<head-sha>/.flow/memory/<id>.md)) — <first_sentence>. Alternatives considered: <parsed alternatives>.` (blob link per §2.4b) Section omitted entirely when array empty (no sentinel "No decisions" line per §2.14). `alternatives_considered` parsed from the stringified-Python-list shape (`"['a', 'b']"` → `a, b`); empty / `"[]"` → trailing clause omitted; plain prose → emitted verbatim.
- [ ] Memory left behind section (workflow.md §2.9): renders when `memory_during_spec.bugs[]` OR `memory_during_spec.architecture_patterns[]` non-empty. Two sub-lists with bold preambles ("**Bugs captured during this spec:**" / "**Architecture patterns captured during this spec:**") when both populated; one sub-list when only one. Each bullet: ``` `<id>` — <first_sentence> ```. Section omitted when both empty.
- [ ] Glossary / strategy notes section (workflow.md §2.10): renders when `glossary_changes` has any non-empty array OR `strategy_alignment.tracks_served[]` non-empty OR `strategy_alignment.drift_flagged[]` non-empty. Glossary line: `**Glossary:** added \`<term>\`; renamed \`<old>\` → \`<new>\` (<N> files); removed \`<term>\`.` (clauses omitted per empty source array; rename clause documented but always empty in v1 per export `_export_glossary_diff` docstring). Strategy lines: `**Strategy:** served tracks \`<track-1>\`, ...` and/or `**Strategy drift:** \`<track>\` — <reason>; ...`. Section heading omitted when all contributions empty.
- [ ] Open items section (workflow.md §2.11): aggregates 3 sources with provenance breadcrumbs:
 - Source A — `spec.spec_sections.open_questions[]` → `- [ ] <question> — open question from spec`
 - Source B — `deferred_findings[].items[]` (branch-slug sink, no per-task attribution) → `- [ ] <stripped raw> — deferred from impl-review (\`<sink-relpath>\`)`
 - Source C — `flowctl show <spec-id> --json | jq '.completion_review_status'` returns `needs_work` → `- [ ] Spec-completion-review verdict was \`needs_work\` (last reviewed <ts>) — flagged by spec-completion-review`
 - Section omitted when all three sources empty. Source order A → B → C.
- [ ] Where to look section (workflow.md §2.12): 5 categories, **questions not labels**:
 - Architecture (≤3 bullets) from `spec.spec_sections.decision_context[]` — anchored to a `diff_summary.files[]` path; bullet dropped when no anchor.
 - Security (≤3 bullets) from `diff_summary.security_sensitive_paths[]` — question whitelist by path heuristic (`auth/`/`crypto/` → trust boundary; `.github/workflows/` → CI scope; `scripts/hooks/` → bypass; `*.pem`/`secret`/`token`/`credential` → safe-to-commit; default → trust boundary).
 - Business correctness (≤2 bullets) when `diff_summary.files[].path` matches `commands/`/`routes/`/`pages/`/`app/`/`cli/`/`hooks/`/`bin/` (same prefixes as Critical changes tier 5).
 - Performance (≤2 bullets) when host agent identifies hot-path heuristics (loops, DB queries, render-body calls) in source-extension files.
 - Tests (1 bullet) when zero `*.test.*` / `*_test.*` / `tests/` / `__tests__/` / `spec/` files in diff. Suppressed when diff is docs-only OR `files_changed < 3 AND lines_added+removed < 30`.
 - Section-level cap: 8 bullets total, trim in reverse-category order (Tests → Performance → Business → Security; Architecture never trimmed).
 - Section omitted when no category fires. Every focus prompt ends with `?`.
- [ ] Each of the 5 sections includes a "What this section MUST NOT do" callout (echo-chamber risk mitigation). Read-only mirror of source data — no paraphrasing, no extending, no inventing rationale to fill gaps.
- [ ] §2.14 honest-empty-state rule honored: NO sentinel "*No decisions for this spec*" / "*No open items*" lines emitted. Absence of section IS the signal.
- [ ] §2.13 section-omission table covers all five context sections.
- [ ] No code snippets in workflow.md prose that would actually generate sections — the prose tells the host agent WHAT to render, not HOW to render programmatically.

---

## Phase 3: Mermaid

**Done when:**

- [ ] `--no-mermaid` short-circuits before any trigger evaluation; body has no `## Structural changes` heading and no standalone prose summaries (workflow.md §3.0).
- [ ] Trigger evaluation walks the 5 conditions: (1) `cross_module_changes[]` non-empty, (2) `public_exports_changed[]` non-empty, (3) new top-level dir, (4) removed top-level dir, (5) >15 files in >3 modules. ≥1 fires → emit section; zero fire → omit entirely.
- [ ] Skip rules engage when applicable: pure additive within one module + <50 LOC; repo has no detectable module structure (no `src/`/`plugins/`/`app/`/etc.); stderr breadcrumb `Phase 3 skipped: <reason>` emitted.
- [ ] Hard caps enforced: max 3 diagrams per PR (collapse to `graph TB` overview when exceeded), max 12 nodes per diagram (group by module/abstraction when exceeded — `scouts (5)` not five sibling nodes), max 25 edges, max 12K chars per codefence.
- [ ] Shape selection picks from 4 shapes: `flowchart LR` (default for trigger 1, function-shape exports), `classDiagram` (class-shape exports — composition / inheritance), `sequenceDiagram` (route handlers / protocol flows), `graph TB` (default for trigger 5, default when collapsing 4+ to 1).
- [ ] Prose-summary-precedes-diagram rule (R13) honored: every codefence preceded by 3-5 sentence plain-language paragraph anchored to `diff_summary.files[]` paths. Self-contained — diagram-removable without losing structural-change signal.
- [ ] Pre-emission validation runs `mermaid-rules.md` §6 checklist (8 rules: quotes balanced, no reserved-word bare ids, no emoji, no MathJax, no relative click links, no inheritance cycles, arrow-char preference, ≤12K chars). Re-render loop on any failure — never emit known-broken codefence.
- [ ] Hallucination guardrails honored: no invented modules / edges / symbols; "fewer nodes, more honest" over "context nodes for clarity"; every node and edge traces to `diff_summary.modules_touched[]` / `diff_summary.files[]` / `cross_module_changes[]` / `public_exports_changed[]`.
- [ ] `mermaid-rules.md` ref file exists with: §1 reserved words (10 entries), §2 special-character escapes + HTML-entity fallback (decimal codes only), §3 shape decision matrix (4 examples — flowchart LR, classDiagram, sequenceDiagram, graph TB), §4 hard caps recap, §5 prose-summary rule, §6 8-item validation checklist.

---

## Phase 4: Push + create PR

**Sub-section ordering.** `--dry-run` (§4.0) short-circuits before any state change; otherwise Phase 4 flows straight to push + create — **no confirm gate**. Layout: 4.0 dry-run short-circuit → 4.1 PR title → 4.2 draft flag → 4.3 body-file persistence → 4.4 length cap → 4.5 (no confirm gate — autonomous create) → 4.6 push + retry loop (4.6a links the PR to the tracker issue) → 4.7 failure hints.

**Done when:**

- [ ] `--dry-run` short-circuits (§4.0) before any state change: in-memory body printed to stdout, no body persisted, no `git push`, no `gh pr create`, no `--memory` write. Exit 0.
- [ ] PR title computed (§4.1) via priority: spec title verbatim if `len <= 72` → first sentence of `goal_and_context` truncated to 70 + `…` → spec id fallback. NO automatic Conventional-Commits prefix injection.
- [ ] `DRAFT_FLAG` matrix (§4.2) computed via four layers: Ralph/autonomous forces draft → open items > 0 default draft → `--draft` forces draft → `--ready` forces ready (Ralph/autonomous layer 1 always wins). Conflict surfaced via stderr note when `--ready` ignored under Ralph/autonomous.
- [ ] `OPEN_ITEMS_COUNT` derived once from Phase 1 payload as `len(open_questions) + sum(deferred_findings.items) + (completion_review_status == "needs_work" ? 1 : 0)`. Same source feeds §2.11 Open items count and §4.2 layer 2.
- [ ] Body delivery via `--body-file` (§4.3) — mktemp + `trap … EXIT` cleanup. Heredoc form documented as anti-pattern with cli/cli #29619 citation.
- [ ] Body length cap (65,000 chars target, ~65,536 GitHub limit) enforced (§4.4) via truncation cascade: drop file list → trim TL;DR → collapse mermaid to overview-only → spill to `.flow/pr-bodies/<spec-id>.md` + commit + replace body with link.
- [ ] No confirm gate (§4.5): make-pr does NOT prompt before push. `--dry-run` (§4.0) is the inspection path; `--ready`/`--draft` override draft state; Phase 0 `plain-text numbered prompt` only resolves missing base/spec (never "create?"). Not-all-tasks-done → warn + proceed as draft.
- [ ] §4.6: `HEAD_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)` resolved at the top of §4.6 + validated non-empty (rejects detached HEAD with stderr error before any push). `gh pr create --head` is non-optional, so an empty `HEAD_BRANCH` would silently expand to nothing and fail with a cryptic "Head sha can't be blank" — fail fast with a clear message instead.
- [ ] §4.6: `git push -u origin HEAD` runs first; on failure, exit 1 with the `git push` error to stderr.
- [ ] After push, `sleep 1` before `gh pr create` (cli/cli #2691 — GitHub API eventual-consistency lag).
- [ ] 3-attempt retry loop on the eventual-consistency error class (`Head sha can't be blank` / `No commits between`). Backoff `2s, 4s, 6s`. Other errors fail fast — auth (401/403), body-too-long (422), PR-already-exists (409) do NOT retry.
- [ ] `gh pr create --title --body-file --base --head [--draft]` invoked with `--base "${BASE_REF#origin/}"` (strip remote-tracking prefix — `gh pr create --base` expects a branch name, not `origin/main`). PR URL captured from stdout (single line; `gh pr create` has no `--json` flag — verified).
- [ ] Failure recovery hints printed to stderr per error class (§4.7): eventual-consistency exhaustion, body-too-long, PR-already-exists, authentication.

---

## Phase 5: Output + footer

**Done when:**

- [ ] Interactive mode: `✅ PR opened: <URL>` printed to stdout with next-steps hint block (`/flow-next:resolve-pr <PR_NUMBER>`, `/flow-next:make-pr ... --dry-run` for body inspection).
- [ ] Ralph mode: `PR_URL=<URL>` single-line on stdout (machine-parseable). All human-readable framing routed to stderr.
- [ ] Footer breadcrumb embedded in body during Phase 2 (already present — restated here): `Generated by /flow-next:make-pr from <spec-id> against <base-ref> on <YYYY-MM-DD>`.
- [ ] `--memory` flag triggers memory write side effect ONLY when `WRITE_MEMORY == 1` AND not dry-run AND `gh pr create` succeeded. Idempotent: skip with stderr note when an entry tagged `spec-<SPEC_ID>` already exists.
- [ ] Memory entry uses `--track knowledge --category architecture-patterns`, with `spec-<SPEC_ID>` as the leading tag (idempotency key) followed by first 2 entries from `modules_touched[]`. `module` field set to first entry of `modules_touched[]` (most-touched module).
- [ ] Memory entry body follows §5.2 fixed-template shape: `## What shipped` + `## R-IDs satisfied` + `## Modules touched` + `## Decisions captured` (omitted when empty) + `## Impact`. Section omission rule honored.
- [ ] Memory entry frontmatter never carries a `spec_id` field (rejected by `validate_memory_frontmatter`); idempotency uses tags only.
- [ ] Memory write failure is **non-fatal** — PR is already open. Stderr warning emitted; skill exits 0.
- [ ] Tempfiles cleaned via `trap 'rm -f "$BODY_FILE" "$MEMORY_BODY_FILE"' EXIT`. No persistent artefacts except the optional memory entry.
- [ ] Ralph mode invariant: PR URL is the sole stdout artefact in `PR_URL=<url>` form; everything else (memory write notes, recovery hints) routes through stderr.

---

## Anti-patterns (workflow.md §Anti-patterns)

Skill prose enumerates 10 forbidden patterns to make v2 enhancement footguns explicit. Documented inline so future authors must consciously violate them:

1. Opening unreviewable PRs (no body / no R-ID coverage).
2. Auto-merging via `gh pr merge` — out of scope per methodology #9.
3. Including raw diff content in body — privacy + duplication risk.
4. Generating `gh pr merge` invocations or suggesting them as next steps.
5. Inflating scope claims beyond what the diff payload supports.
6. Heredoc body delivery — `--body-file` is the only reliable form for LLM-generated content.
7. Silent fallback to manual `git push` + `curl` API when `gh` missing.
8. Ralph-blocking the skill — autonomous-loop terminus is the design point.
9. Auto-writing memory entries without `--memory` opt-in.
10. Renumbering R-IDs in the coverage table.

---

## Cross-phase invariants

- **Hallucination guardrails** (see SKILL.md): every body claim traces to a payload field. Honest "unclear" beats plausible "wrong".
- **No raw diff content in body**: paths, churn, modules only.
- **No `gh pr merge`**: skill creates and exits.
- **NOT Ralph-blocked**: skill runs under Ralph and pilot-style autonomous mode alike; PR is created directly in every mode — under Ralph/autonomous the only differences are forced `--draft` + Phase 0 hard-errors instead of info prompts (the `PR_URL=` stdout line stays Ralph-only).
- **Body ≤8000 chars**: hard cap. Collapse in priority order (drop full file list → trim TL;DR → collapse mermaid to overview-only).
- **PR artifact discipline** (Phase 1.5, only when `artifacts.html.enabled`): read-only review instrument — never a Lavish session/poll from make-pr; `--dry-run` writes no artifact; the only state change is the single narrow `chore(flow): pr artifact <spec-id>` commit; artifact failure never blocks the PR.
