# PR Feedback Resolver Workflow

Execute these phases in order. Each phase gates on the prior one. Stop on error and surface to user — never plow through with bad state.

## Preamble

```bash
set -e
FLOWCTL="$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl"
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"
SCRIPTS="$HOME/.codex/skills/flow-next-resolve-pr/scripts"
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
```

Confirm `gh` auth up-front:

```bash
gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "gh not authenticated. Run: gh auth login"; exit 1; }
```

---

## Phase 0: Parse arguments

Strip flags first; remaining token is the target.

```bash
DRY_RUN=0
NO_CLUSTER=0
AUTONOMOUS=0
TARGET=""

for arg in $ARGUMENTS; do
 case "$arg" in
 --dry-run) DRY_RUN=1 ;;
 --no-cluster) NO_CLUSTER=1 ;;
 mode:autonomous) AUTONOMOUS=1 ;;
 *) TARGET="$arg" ;;
 esac
done

# Secondary signal: process-level autonomous driver (env survives only
# within one process tree; the token is the primary, prose-safe carrier).
if [[ "${FLOW_AUTONOMOUS:-}" == "1" ]]; then
 AUTONOMOUS=1
fi
```

`AUTONOMOUS=1` flips question-suppression branches ONLY (Phase 10): the needs-human surface reports instead of blocking, and the run ends with the machine-readable `RESOLVE_PR_VERDICT=` terminal line. Autonomy ≠ Ralph — neither signal sets `FLOW_RALPH`, implies `REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH` receipt obligations, or activates ralph-guard hooks. Every other phase (triage, demotion/skip logic, cluster gate, dispatch, validation, commit, reply/resolve, the 2-cycle bound) behaves identically in both modes.

Detect mode from `TARGET`. Regex matches are authoritative — do not relax:

| TARGET shape | Regex | Mode | TARGETED_TYPE |
|---|---|---|---|
| empty | — | full, detect PR from current branch | — |
| pure number | `^[0-9]+$` | full, that PR | — |
| PR URL | `^https://github\.com/.+/pull/[0-9]+$` | full, parse PR number | — |
| review-thread comment URL | `^https://github\.com/.+/pull/[0-9]+#discussion_r[0-9]+$` | targeted | `review_thread` |
| top-level PR comment URL | `^https://github\.com/.+/pull/[0-9]+#issuecomment-[0-9]+$` | targeted | `pr_comment` |

Set `MODE=full` or `MODE=targeted` based on the match; for targeted also set `TARGETED_TYPE` and extract `OWNER`, `REPO`, `PR_NUMBER`, and `COMMENT_REST_ID` from the URL via regex capture.

```bash
MODE=full
TARGETED_TYPE=""
if [[ "$TARGET" =~ ^https://github\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/pull/([0-9]+)#discussion_r([0-9]+)$ ]]; then
 MODE=targeted; TARGETED_TYPE=review_thread
 OWNER="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"; REPO="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
 PR_NUMBER="${BASH_REMATCH[3]}"; COMMENT_REST_ID="${BASH_REMATCH[4]}"
elif [[ "$TARGET" =~ ^https://github\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/pull/([0-9]+)#issuecomment-([0-9]+)$ ]]; then
 MODE=targeted; TARGETED_TYPE=pr_comment
 OWNER="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"; REPO="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
 PR_NUMBER="${BASH_REMATCH[3]}"; COMMENT_REST_ID="${BASH_REMATCH[4]}"
elif [[ "$TARGET" =~ ^https://github\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/pull/([0-9]+)$ ]]; then
 OWNER="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"; REPO="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"; PR_NUMBER="${BASH_REMATCH[3]}"
elif [[ "$TARGET" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
 PR_NUMBER="$TARGET"
fi
```

Any non-empty `TARGET` that matches none of the above → error out: "Unrecognized target. Expected PR number, PR URL, or comment URL (#discussion_rN or #issuecomment-N)."

---

## Phase 1: Detect PR + fetch feedback

```bash
if [[ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]]; then
 PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number 2>/dev/null || true)
 if [[ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ]]; then
 echo "No open PR on current branch. Provide PR number, PR URL, or comment URL."
 exit 1
 fi
fi

FEEDBACK_JSON=$(bash "$SCRIPTS/get-pr-comments" "$PR_NUMBER")
```

`FEEDBACK_JSON` shape (from `get-pr-comments`):

```json
{
 "pr_number": 123,
 "review_threads": [{"id": "PRRT_...", "isOutdated": false, "path": "...", "line": 42, "originalLine": 40, "startLine": null, "originalStartLine": null, "comments": [...]}],
 "pr_comments": [{"id": "IC_...", "author": "...", "body": "...", "createdAt": "..."}],
 "review_bodies": [{"id": "PRR_...", "author": "...", "body": "...", "state": "COMMENTED", "submittedAt": "..."}],
 "cross_invocation": {"signal": true|false, "resolved_threads": [{"id": "...", "path": "...", "line": 42}]}
}
```

**Targeted mode** — narrow `FEEDBACK_JSON` to the single item identified by the URL.

For `TARGETED_TYPE=review_thread` (inline review comment):

```bash
COMMENT_NODE_ID=$(gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/pulls/comments/$COMMENT_REST_ID" --jq .node_id)
THREAD_JSON=$(bash "$SCRIPTS/get-thread-for-comment" "$PR_NUMBER" "$COMMENT_NODE_ID" "$OWNER/$REPO")
THREAD_ID=$(jq -r .id <<<"$THREAD_JSON")
# Keep only the matching thread; drop pr_comments + review_bodies; zero cross-invocation signal.
FEEDBACK_JSON=$(jq --arg tid "$THREAD_ID" '
 .review_threads |= map(select(.id == $tid))
 | .pr_comments = []
 | .review_bodies = []
 | .cross_invocation = {signal: false, resolved_threads: []}
' <<<"$FEEDBACK_JSON")
```

For `TARGETED_TYPE=pr_comment` (top-level PR comment) — bypass thread lookup entirely, fetch the single comment via REST and build a minimal feedback payload:

```bash
PR_COMMENT_JSON=$(gh api "repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_REST_ID" \
 --jq '{id: .node_id, author: .user.login, body: .body, createdAt: .created_at}')
FEEDBACK_JSON=$(jq --argjson c "$PR_COMMENT_JSON" --arg pr "$PR_NUMBER" '
 {
 pr_number: ($pr | tonumber),
 review_threads: [],
 pr_comments: [$c],
 review_bodies: [],
 cross_invocation: {signal: false, resolved_threads: []}
 }' <<<'{}')
```

If `FEEDBACK_JSON` is empty (`review_threads=[]`, `pr_comments=[]`, `review_bodies=[]`), skip to Phase 10 with "no open feedback" message.

---

## Phase 2: Triage — new vs pending vs dropped

**Targeted mode skips this phase entirely** — the user explicitly asked for that one item, treat it as `new` regardless of triage heuristics:

```bash
if [[ "$MODE" == "targeted" ]]; then
 echo "Triage: skipped (targeted mode — single item)."
 # Fall through to Phase 3 with the single item marked new.
fi
```

Full-mode triage rules below.

For each `review_thread`:

- **Last comment by PR author with substantive reply** → already-addressed → drop (and log as "still pending from a previous run" if the last non-author comment was after the author's reply).
- **Last comment by non-author containing phrases like** "will address", "thinking through", "deferred", "need to align", "let me think" → pending decision → skip (mention in summary as "still pending").
- **Last comment by non-author is a question** with no substantive author response → pending decision unless the question is explicitly action-ready ("please fix X") → skip.
- **Otherwise** → new → process.

For each `pr_comment` / `review_body`:

Apply two filters in order:

1. **Actionability filter (silent drop — never mention in summary):**
 - Review-wrapper boilerplate: "Here are some automated review suggestions...", "Reviewed by CodeRabbit", coderabbitai summary tables, copilot review-wrapper headers, etc.
 - Approvals with no body text beyond "LGTM" / "Approved" / a single checkmark.
 - CI summary posts: status badges, deploy previews, test coverage reports, codecov summaries.
 - Bot-generated wrapper headers of automated review tools (e.g., "Claude Code review", "CodeRabbit summary", "PR description updated by bot").
2. **Already-replied filter (skip, don't drop silently):**
 - Scan the PR's conversation for a reply quoting this feedback (`> `-prefixed line matching substring of the feedback body).
 - If a matching quoted reply exists → skip with "still pending" note.

Counts to announce:

```
Triage: N new, M pending, K dropped (non-actionable).
```

If `N == 0`, skip to Phase 10 (summary) with a "nothing new to address" message.

---

## Phase 3: Cluster analysis (gated)

Read [cluster-analysis.md](cluster-analysis.md) for full gate logic and dispatch rules.

**Targeted mode skips this phase entirely** — single-item dispatch, no cluster surface:

```bash
if [[ "$MODE" == "targeted" ]]; then
 echo "Cluster analysis: skipped (targeted mode — single item)."
 # Skip to Phase 4 with the single item as its own unit.
fi
```

Full-mode gate (both must pass):

1. `FEEDBACK_JSON.cross_invocation.signal == true` (≥1 resolved thread exists).
2. Spatial-overlap precheck — ≥1 new `review_thread` shares a file path or directory subtree with a resolved thread.

If gate fails **or** `NO_CLUSTER=1`: skip clustering → every new item is its own unit.

If gate passes:

- Categorize new + resolved threads into one of: `error-handling`, `validation`, `type-safety`, `naming`, `performance`, `testing`, `security`, `documentation`, `style`, `architecture`, `other`.
- Form clusters: same category + shared file/subtree + contains ≥1 prior-resolved.
- Synthesize cluster brief — hypothesis + prior-resolutions list.

---

## Phase 4: Plan

Build `UNITS` — mixed list of clusters (1 unit each) and non-clustered individual items.

Per unit, record:

- `unit_type`: `cluster` | `thread` | `pr_comment` | `review_body`
- `feedback_ids`: list of node IDs
- `files`: file-paths touched (threads carry paths; clusters aggregate across threads; pr_comments / review_bodies have empty file lists and rely on the resolver to locate code)
- `cluster_brief` (for clusters only)

**Dry-run exit:**

```bash
if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == "1" ]]; then
 echo "Plan:"
 echo "$UNITS" | jq .
 echo "Exiting (--dry-run)."
 exit 0
fi
```

---

## Phase 5: Dispatch

This is the only backend-divergent phase in the workflow. All other phases are platform-agnostic shell + GraphQL — kept inline per the backend-split heuristic documented in `agent_docs/adding-skills.md`.

### Platform detection

- **Claude Code** exposes the `Task` tool with `subagent_type` parameter → parallel dispatch.
- **Codex** (0.102.0+) ships native multi-agent role support. `pr-comment-resolver.toml` installs into `~/.codex/agents/` via `scripts/install-codex.sh`; spawn in parallel using Codex's multi-agent orchestration (same pattern as planning scouts).
- **Copilot / Droid** → serial loop (execute resolver steps inline, one unit at a time).

Default to serial when in doubt — output is identical, only throughput differs.

### Parallel dispatch (Claude Code + Codex) — with file-overlap avoidance

1. Build file sets per unit (cluster file lists + individual thread paths).
2. Pair overlap: two units overlap if their file sets intersect.
3. Topological-style serialization: units with no overlap run in the same wave; overlapping units wait for their predecessor.
4. Batch size per wave: **4 units** max (applies when many units have empty file sets — e.g. pr_comments).
5. Dispatch each wave:
 - Claude Code → parallel `Task` calls with `subagent_type: pr-comment-resolver`.
 - Codex → parallel spawn of the `pr-comment-resolver` role via Codex's multi-agent orchestration.
 Pass the inputs documented in `agents/pr-comment-resolver.md`.
6. Collect all verdict JSONs.

### Serial dispatch (Copilot / Droid)

Loop over `UNITS` in cluster-first order (clusters carry higher leverage). For each unit, perform the resolver steps inline — read code, decide verdict, compose reply, apply any edits — following `agents/pr-comment-resolver.md`. Append the verdict JSON to `VERDICTS`.

### Verdict JSON per unit

See `agents/pr-comment-resolver.md` — fields: `verdict`, `feedback_id`, `feedback_type`, `reply_text`, `files_changed`, `reason`, optional `cluster_assessment`, optional `decision_context` (for `needs-human`).

---

## Phase 6: Validate combined state

```bash
CHANGED_FILES=$(echo "$VERDICTS" | jq -r '[.[] | .files_changed[]] | unique | .[]')

if [[ -z "$CHANGED_FILES" ]]; then
 echo "No code changes — skipping validation."
else
 # Project's validation command, typically in AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md.
 # Common: bun test | pnpm test | npm test | cargo test | go test ./... | pytest
 # Read the project's preferred command; run once.
 echo "Running project validation..."
 PROJECT_TEST_CMD="$(... read from project docs ...)"
 $PROJECT_TEST_CMD
fi
```

Validation branches:

- **Green** → proceed to Phase 7.
- **Red, failures touch files in `CHANGED_FILES`** → one inline diagnose-and-fix pass (update the Edit / Write edits that likely caused the failure); re-run. Still red → demote those units to `needs-human` with test output in `decision_context`. Do **not** commit the failing code.
- **Red, failures touch only files NOT in `CHANGED_FILES`** → pre-existing failure. Proceed with commit; append footer note: `Note: pre-existing failure in <test path> not addressed by this PR.`

---

## Phase 7: Commit + push

Only when at least one unit has non-empty `files_changed` and wasn't demoted to `needs-human` in Phase 6.

```bash
# Stage only files resolvers explicitly reported. NEVER git add -A / git add .
while IFS= read -r file; do
 [[ -n "$file" ]] && git add -- "$file"
done <<< "$CHANGED_FILES"

# Commit message: one-line subject + bullet per change + PR reference.
git commit -m "Address PR review feedback (#$PR_NUMBER)

$(echo "$VERDICTS" | jq -r '.[] | select(.files_changed|length>0) | "- " + .reason')
${PRE_EXISTING_FAILURE_NOTE:-}"

git push
```

---

## Phase 8: Reply + resolve

Per unit:

| `feedback_type` | Reply via | Resolve via |
|---|---|---|
| `review_thread` | `reply-to-pr-thread` | `resolve-pr-thread` (skip if `verdict == needs-human`) |
| `pr_comment` | `gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "<reply_text>"` | (none — no GraphQL resolve for top-level comments) |
| `review_body` | `gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "<reply_text>"` | (none) |

```bash
# Iterate verdicts as compact JSON objects (one per line). Plain `for VERDICT
# in $VERDICTS` performs shell word-splitting and breaks any time reply_text
# contains spaces or newlines — which is the common case for human-facing
# replies. Read line-by-line instead so each loop body receives one complete
# verdict object.
jq -c '.[]' <<<"$VERDICTS" | while IFS= read -r VERDICT; do
 FB_TYPE=$(jq -r .feedback_type <<<"$VERDICT")
 FB_ID=$(jq -r .feedback_id <<<"$VERDICT")
 REPLY=$(jq -r .reply_text <<<"$VERDICT")
 V=$(jq -r .verdict <<<"$VERDICT")

 case "$FB_TYPE" in
 review_thread)
 echo "$REPLY" | bash "$SCRIPTS/reply-to-pr-thread" "$FB_ID"
 [[ "$V" != "needs-human" ]] && bash "$SCRIPTS/resolve-pr-thread" "$FB_ID"
 ;;
 pr_comment|review_body)
 gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body "$REPLY"
 ;;
 esac
done
```

`$VERDICTS` is the full array of verdict objects as a single JSON string
(as produced in Phase 6). `jq -c '.[]'` emits one compact JSON object per
line; `while read -r` keeps each object intact through the pipe.

Reply body already carries `> quoted feedback\n\n<response>` from the resolver — the orchestrator does not rewrap.

---

## Phase 9: Verify + loop

```bash
REMAINING=$(bash "$SCRIPTS/get-pr-comments" "$PR_NUMBER" | jq '.review_threads | length')
```

If `REMAINING > 0` **and** some of those threads aren't in the `needs-human` set (which will legitimately stay open):

- **Cycles < 2** → loop to Phase 2.
- **Cycles >= 2** (this would be the 3rd pass) → stop. Surface a pattern summary:
 ```
 Multiple rounds on <dominant theme> suggest a deeper issue.
 Fixed across cycles: <list>
 Recurring theme: <common category / file / concern>
 Suggest addressing at the architecture level before continuing.
 ```

The 2-cycle bound is identical in both modes. Under `AUTONOMOUS=1` the escalation still stops the loop here; Phase 10 then reports it as part of the `NEEDS_HUMAN` verdict instead of waiting on the user.

---

## Phase 9.5: Tracker sync (opt-in) — optional resolution comment

**Optional. Runs only when the tracker bridge is active AND `resolvePr` is opted in, after the resolution pass settles (Phase 9 found nothing left to loop on, or only `needs-human` threads remain). With no tracker configured this is a no-op.** Posts an optional resolution comment to the linked tracker issue summarizing what was addressed on the PR — append-only (R8), conflict-free.

The linked spec id comes from the PR's spec association (the same `SPEC_ID` make-pr used; resolve `flowctl show <spec-id>` from the branch / PR body breadcrumb as elsewhere in this skill).

```bash
if [ "$($FLOWCTL sync active --json | jq -r '.active')" = "true" ] \
 && [ "$($FLOWCTL config get tracker.perEvent.resolvePr --json | jq -r '.value')" != "off" ] \
 && [ "$($FLOWCTL config get tracker.perEvent.resolvePr --json | jq -r '.value')" != "null" ]; then
 # Invoke the flow-next-tracker-sync skill: append a one-line resolution comment
 # to the linked issue (e.g. "Addressed N of M review items on PR #<NUMBER>").
 # skill: flow-next-tracker-sync (operation: comment <spec-id>)
 # Unlinked spec → flow-first push (create + link) first, then comment
 # (tracker-sync §Phase 3 create-if-unlinked). No-op only if no transport reachable.
 # Best-effort — never blocks the resolve-pr summary.
 :
fi
```

---

## Phase 10: Summary output

```
Resolved N of M new items on PR #<NUMBER>:

Fixed (count): <bullet list from `fixed` verdicts — one line each, from `reason`>
Fixed differently (count): <bullet list from `fixed-differently`>
Replied (count): <bullet list from `replied`>
Not addressing (count): <bullet list from `not-addressing`>

Validation: <"bun test 893/893 passed" | "skipped (no code changes)" | "pre-existing failure in <path>">

Cluster investigations (count):
 1. <theme> in <area>: <cluster_assessment>

Needs your input (count):
 1. <decision_context.why_needs_decision from the agent>
 Options: <options[].action — comma-separated>
 Lean: <decision_context.lean>

Still pending from a previous run (count):
 1. <thread path:line> — <brief>
 Previous reply: <comment URL>
```

**Ask the user via plain text.** Render the options below as a numbered list `1.` … `N.`, followed by a final option `N+1. Other — type your own answer`. Print the question, then the numbered list, then **stop and wait for the user's next message before continuing**. Parse the reply as: a bare number `1`–`N+1` → that option; the literal text of an option label → that option; free text after `Other` → custom answer.

**Interactive mode (`AUTONOMOUS=0`):** for `needs-human` entries **and** "still pending" entries where the user might want to weigh in: invoke `plain-text numbered prompt`. Wait for response; apply decisions; loop back to Phase 5 for any newly actionable items.

If none block, exit 0 with the printed summary.

**Autonomous mode (`AUTONOMOUS=1`):** there is no user to answer — never wait on a question. Instead:

- For each `needs-human` entry, emit one report line after the summary: `NEEDS_HUMAN: <path:line | comment id> — <one-line reason from decision_context.why_needs_decision>`. The threads stay open (Phase 8 already skipped resolving them); no decision is applied, no loop back to Phase 5.
- The cycle-3 escalation from Phase 9, if it fired, counts as one `NEEDS_HUMAN` line: `NEEDS_HUMAN: cycle-budget — <recurring theme, one line>`.
- End the run with exactly ONE machine-readable terminal line — the LAST line of output, nothing after it (the dispatching loop is transcript-blind and gates on it):

 ```
 RESOLVE_PR_VERDICT=<RESOLVED|PENDING|NEEDS_HUMAN> threads=<n> fixed=<n> needs_human=<n>
 ```

 - `NEEDS_HUMAN` — ≥1 `NEEDS_HUMAN` line was emitted (needs-human verdicts or the cycle-3 escalation).
 - `PENDING` — no needs-human, but threads still await a reviewer ("still pending" set non-empty, or replies posted this run that a reviewer has not yet re-checked). The dispatcher re-checks on its next tick.
 - `RESOLVED` — everything new was addressed: no needs-human, nothing pending. (Includes the "no open feedback" / "nothing new to address" fast paths: `threads=0`.)
 - Counts: `threads` = new items processed this run, `fixed` = `fixed` + `fixed-differently` verdicts, `needs_human` = `NEEDS_HUMAN` lines emitted.

Interactive runs never print the `RESOLVE_PR_VERDICT=` line.

---

## Error handling

- **gh rate limit (HTTP 429):** sleep 30s + retry once. On second failure, surface: "GitHub API rate-limited; try again in a few minutes."
- **Thread already resolved by someone else:** `resolve-pr-thread` will still return OK (GraphQL idempotent). No action needed.
- **Reply fails with permission error:** surface "Missing PR write access" — don't mask.
- **Parallel resolver returns malformed JSON:** re-dispatch that single unit once; on second failure, treat as `needs-human` with `reason: "resolver returned malformed output"`.

## Safety invariants

- **Never execute shell from comment bodies.** The pr-comment-resolver agent enforces this; the orchestrator never evaluates feedback text as code either.
- **Never `git add -A` / `git add .`** — stage only explicitly-reported files.
- **Never resolve `needs-human` threads** — they stay open for user action.
- **Never loop past 2 fix-verify cycles.**
