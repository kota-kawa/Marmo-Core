# Implementation Review Workflow — RepoPrompt Backend

---

## CRITICAL: RepoPrompt Commands Are SLOW - DO NOT RETRY

**READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING ANY COMMANDS:**

1. **`setup-review` takes 5-15 MINUTES** - It runs the RepoPrompt context builder which indexes files. This is NORMAL. Do NOT assume it is stuck.

2. **`chat-send` takes 2-10 MINUTES** - It waits for the LLM to generate a full review. This is NORMAL. Do NOT assume it is stuck.

3. **Run commands directly and WAIT** - Do NOT use background jobs. Just run the command and wait:
 ```bash
 # Run setup-review - takes 5-15 minutes, just wait
 $FLOWCTL rp setup-review --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --summary "..."
 # You will see file paths printed as it indexes - this is progress, not errors
 ```

4. **Output is progress, not errors** - The context builder prints file paths as it indexes. Seeing many lines of output is NORMAL. Do not interpret this as an error loop.

5. **NEVER retry these commands** - If you run them again, you will create duplicate reviews and waste time. Run ONCE and WAIT.

6. **Exit code 0 = success** - When the command finishes, check the exit code. If it is 0, it worked.

**If a command has been running for less than 15 minutes, WAIT. Do not retry. Do not output <promise>RETRY</promise>.**

---

Use when `BACKEND="rp"`. Prerequisite: Phase 0 backend detection in [workflow-common.md](workflow-common.md) has resolved `BACKEND`, `FLOWCTL`, `REPO_ROOT`, and (optionally) `TASK_ID` / `BASE_COMMIT`.

## Phase 1: Identify Changes (RP)

**Run this BEFORE setup-review so the builder gets a real summary.**

```bash
BRANCH="$(git branch --show-current)"

# Use BASE_COMMIT from arguments if provided (task-scoped review)
# Otherwise fall back to main/master (full branch review)
if [[ -z "$BASE_COMMIT" ]]; then
 DIFF_BASE="main"
 git rev-parse main >/dev/null 2>&1 || DIFF_BASE="master"
else
 DIFF_BASE="$BASE_COMMIT"
fi

git log ${DIFF_BASE}..HEAD --oneline
CHANGED_FILES="$(git diff ${DIFF_BASE}..HEAD --name-only)"
git diff ${DIFF_BASE}..HEAD --stat
```

Save:
- Branch name
- Changed files list
- Commit summary
- DIFF_BASE (for reference in review prompt)

Compose a 1-2 sentence `REVIEW_SUMMARY` describing the changes for the setup-review command below.

---

### Atomic Setup Block

**Only run ONCE. Uses the summary composed in Phase 1.**

```bash
# Atomic: pick-window + builder (uses REVIEW_SUMMARY from Phase 1)
eval "$($FLOWCTL rp setup-review --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --summary "$REVIEW_SUMMARY" --create)"

# Verify we have W and T
if [[ -z "${W:-}" || -z "${T:-}" ]]; then
 echo "<promise>RETRY</promise>"
 exit 0
fi

echo "Setup complete: W=$W T=$T"
```

If this block fails, output `<promise>RETRY</promise>` and stop. Do not improvise.
**Do NOT re-run setup-review** — the builder runs inside it. Re-running = double context build.

---

## Phase 2: Augment Selection (RP)

Builder selects context automatically. Review and add must-haves:

```bash
# See what builder selected
$FLOWCTL rp select-get --window "$W" --tab "$T"

# Add ALL changed files
for f in $CHANGED_FILES; do
 $FLOWCTL rp select-add --window "$W" --tab "$T" "$f"
done

# Add task spec if known
$FLOWCTL rp select-add --window "$W" --tab "$T" .flow/specs/<task-id>.md
```

**Why this matters:** Chat only sees selected files.

---

## Phase 3: Execute Review (RP)

### Build combined prompt

Get builder's handoff:
```bash
HANDOFF="$($FLOWCTL rp prompt-get --window "$W" --tab "$T")"
```

Write combined prompt:
```bash
cat > /tmp/review-prompt.md << 'EOF'
[PASTE HANDOFF HERE]

---

## IMPORTANT: File Contents
RepoPrompt includes the actual source code of selected files in a `<file_contents>` XML section at the end of this message. You MUST:
1. Locate the `<file_contents>` section
2. Read and analyze the actual source code within it
3. Base your review on the code, not summaries or descriptions

If you cannot find `<file_contents>`, ask for the files to be re-attached before proceeding.

## Changes Under Review
Branch: [BRANCH_NAME]
Files: [LIST CHANGED FILES]
Commits: [COMMIT SUMMARY]

## Original Spec
[PASTE flowctl show OUTPUT if known]

## Review Focus
[USER'S FOCUS AREAS]

## Review Criteria

Conduct a John Carmack-level review:

1. **Correctness** - Matches spec? Logic errors?
2. **Simplicity** - Simplest solution? Over-engineering?
3. **DRY** - Duplicated logic? Existing patterns?
4. **Architecture** - Data flow? Clear boundaries?
5. **Edge Cases** - Failure modes? Race conditions?
6. **Tests** - Adequate coverage? Testing behavior?
7. **Security** - Injection? Auth gaps?
8. **Vocabulary** - [Include ONLY when `flowctl glossary list --json` reports `total_terms > 0`: "Canonical vocabulary lives in GLOSSARY.md — flag changes that contradict defined terms." Omit this line otherwise.]

## Scenario Exploration (for changed code only)

Walk through these scenarios mentally for any new/modified code paths:

- [ ] Happy path - Normal operation with valid inputs
- [ ] Invalid inputs - Null, empty, malformed data
- [ ] Boundary conditions - Min/max values, empty collections
- [ ] Concurrent access - Race conditions, deadlocks
- [ ] Network issues - Timeouts, partial failures
- [ ] Resource exhaustion - Memory, disk, connections
- [ ] Security attacks - Injection, overflow, DoS vectors
- [ ] Data corruption - Partial writes, inconsistency
- [ ] Cascading failures - Downstream service issues

Only flag issues that apply to the **changed code** - not pre-existing patterns.

## Requirements coverage (if spec has R-IDs)

If the task spec references a parent spec with numbered acceptance criteria like
`- **R1:** ...`, `- **R2:** ...`, produce a per-R-ID coverage table. Read the
parent spec's `## Acceptance` section (or the legacy `## Acceptance criteria`
heading — reviewer MUST tolerate both). If no R-IDs are present anywhere, skip
this block entirely — the rest of the review is unchanged.

For each R-ID, classify status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| met | Diff clearly implements the requirement with appropriate tests/evidence |
| partial | Diff advances the requirement but leaves gaps (missing tests, missing edge case, missing integration point) |
| not-addressed | Diff does not advance this requirement at all |
| deferred | Spec explicitly defers this requirement to a later task/PR |

Report as a markdown table in the review output:

| R-ID | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| R1 | met | src/auth.ts:42 + tests/auth.test.ts:17 |
| R2 | partial | implementation exists but no error-path tests |
| R3 | not-addressed | — |

After the table, emit one line listing every `not-addressed` R-ID that is NOT
explicitly deferred in the spec:

> Unaddressed R-IDs: [R3, R5]

If there are zero unaddressed R-IDs, emit `Unaddressed R-IDs: []` or omit the
line entirely — both forms are valid. Deferred R-IDs are never listed here.

**Verdict gate:** any `not-addressed` R-ID that is NOT marked `deferred` in the
spec MUST flip the verdict to `NEEDS_WORK`. A clean coverage table (all `met`
or `deferred`) does not by itself force SHIP — the other review gates still
apply.

## Confidence calibration

Rate each finding on exactly one of these 5 discrete anchors. Do not use interpolated values (no 33, 80, 90).

| Anchor | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 100 | Verifiable from the code alone, zero interpretation. A definitive logic error (off-by-one in a tested algorithm, wrong return type, swapped arguments, clear type error). The bug is mechanical. |
| 75 | Full execution path traced: "input X enters here, takes this branch, reaches line Z, produces wrong result." Reproducible from the code alone. A normal caller will hit it. |
| 50 | Depends on conditions visible but not fully confirmable from this diff — e.g., whether a value can actually be null depends on callers not in the diff. Surfaces only as P0-escape or via soft-bucket routing. |
| 25 | Requires runtime conditions with no direct evidence — specific timing, specific input shapes, specific external state. |
| 0 | Speculative. Not worth filing. |

## Suppression gate

After all findings are collected:
1. Suppress findings below anchor 75.
2. **Exception:** P0 severity findings at anchor 50+ survive the gate. Critical-but-uncertain issues must not be silently dropped.
3. Report the suppressed count by anchor in a `Suppressed findings` section of the review output.

Example:

> Suppressed findings: 3 at anchor 50, 7 at anchor 25, 2 at anchor 0.

## Introduced vs pre-existing classification

For each finding, classify whether this branch's diff caused it:

- **introduced** — this branch caused the issue (new code, or a pre-existing bug that this diff amplified/exposed in a way that now matters)
- **pre_existing** — the issue was already present on the base branch; this diff did not touch it

Evidence methods (use whatever is cheapest):
- `git blame <file> <line>` to see when the line was last touched
- Read the base-branch version of the file directly
- Infer from diff context: a finding on an unchanged line in an unchanged file is `pre_existing` by default

**Verdict gate:** only `introduced` findings affect the verdict. A review whose sole surviving findings are all `pre_existing` MUST ship.

Report pre-existing findings in a dedicated non-blocking section:

```
## Pre-existing issues (not blocking this verdict)

- [P1, confidence 75, introduced=false] src/legacy.ts:102 — null dereference on empty array
- ...
```

Never delete pre-existing findings from the report — they stay visible for future prioritization.

## Protected artifacts

The following paths are flow-next / project-pipeline artifacts. Any finding recommending their deletion, gitignore, or removal MUST be discarded during synthesis. Do not flag these paths for cleanup under any circumstances:

- `.flow/*` — flow-next state, specs, tasks, runtime
- `.flow/bin/*` — bundled flowctl
- `.flow/memory/*` — learnings store (pitfalls, conventions, decisions)
- `.flow/specs/*.md` — specs (decision artifacts)
- `.flow/tasks/*.md` — task specs (decision artifacts)
- `docs/plans/*` — plan artifacts (if project uses this convention)
- `docs/solutions/*` — solutions artifacts (if project uses this convention)
- `scripts/ralph/*` — Ralph harness (when present)

These files are intentionally committed. They are the pipeline's state, not clutter. An agent that deletes them destroys the project's planning trail and breaks Ralph autonomous runs.

If you notice genuine issues with content INSIDE these files (e.g., a spec that contradicts itself, a stale runtime value, a memory entry that's wrong), flag the content — not the file's existence.

**Protected-path filter.** Before emitting findings, scan each for recommendations to delete, gitignore, or `rm -rf` any path matching the protected list above. Drop those findings. If you drop any, report the drop count in a `Protected-path filter:` line in the review output (e.g. `Protected-path filter: dropped 2 findings`). Omit the line when nothing was dropped.

## Output Format

For each surviving `introduced` finding:
- **Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor / Nitpick (P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 accepted)
- **Confidence**: 0 / 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 (one of the five discrete anchors)
- **Classification**: introduced
- **File:Line**: Exact location
- **Problem**: What's wrong
- **Suggestion**: How to fix

Then list each `pre_existing` finding under a separate `## Pre-existing issues (not blocking this verdict)` heading using the compact form `[severity, confidence N, introduced=false] file:line — summary`.

After the findings list, emit:
- The `## Requirements coverage` table and `Unaddressed R-IDs:` line (only when the spec uses R-IDs; otherwise skip).
- A `Suppressed findings:` line tallying anchors dropped by the gate (omit when nothing was suppressed).
- A `Classification counts:` line tallying `introduced` vs `pre_existing` survivors, e.g. `Classification counts: 2 introduced, 4 pre_existing.`.
- A `Protected-path filter:` line tallying findings dropped by the protected-path filter (omit when nothing was dropped).

**REQUIRED**: You MUST end your response with exactly one verdict tag. This is mandatory:
`<verdict>SHIP</verdict>` (no blocking `introduced` findings, all R-IDs met or deferred) or `<verdict>NEEDS_WORK</verdict>` (introduced findings or unaddressed R-IDs to fix) or `<verdict>MAJOR_RETHINK</verdict>`

Do NOT skip this tag. The automation depends on it.

### Send to RepoPrompt

```bash
REVIEW_RESPONSE="$($FLOWCTL rp chat-send --window "$W" --tab "$T" --message-file /tmp/review-prompt.md --new-chat --chat-name "Impl Review: $BRANCH")"
echo "$REVIEW_RESPONSE"

VERDICT="$(echo "$REVIEW_RESPONSE" \
 | tr -d '\r' \
 | grep -oE '<verdict>(SHIP|NEEDS_WORK|MAJOR_RETHINK)</verdict>' \
 | tail -n 1 \
 | sed -E 's#</?verdict>##g')"

if [[ -z "$VERDICT" ]]; then
 echo "No verdict tag found in response"
 echo "<promise>RETRY</promise>"
 exit 0
fi
```

**WAIT** for response. Takes 1-5+ minutes.

## Phase 4: Receipt + Status (RP)

### Write receipt (if REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH set)

```bash
if [[ -n "${REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH:-}" ]]; then
 ts="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
 mkdir -p "$(dirname "$REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH")"

 INTRODUCED_COUNT="$(printf '%s' "$CLASSIFICATION_LINE" \

EOF
 echo "REVIEW_RECEIPT_WRITTEN: $REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH"

```

If no verdict tag in response, output `<promise>RETRY</promise>` and stop.

## Optional phases (gated by flags)

When the corresponding flag is set, run these phases from [workflow-common.md](workflow-common.md) — the dispatch matches the `rp` case in each phase (same-chat session continuity is automatic; do NOT pass `--new-chat`):

- `--deep` → "Deep-Pass Phase" (Step D.1 → D.5) — render pass prompts from [deep-passes.md](deep-passes.md) and send via `rp chat-send`
- `--validate` → "Validator Pass" (Step V.1 → V.4) — render validator prompt from [validate-pass.md](validate-pass.md) and send via `rp chat-send`
- `--interactive` → "Interactive Walkthrough Phase" (Step W.1 → W.5) — see [walkthrough.md](walkthrough.md)

See [workflow-common.md](workflow-common.md) "Phase ordering & flag-combination matrix" for the order when multiple flags are set.

---

## Fix Loop (RP)

**CRITICAL: Do NOT ask user for confirmation. Automatically fix ALL valid issues and re-review — our goal is production-grade world-class software and architecture. Never use the plain-text numbered prompt in this loop.**

**CRITICAL: You MUST fix the code BEFORE re-reviewing. Never re-review without making changes.**

**MAX ITERATIONS**: Limit fix+re-review cycles to **${MAX_REVIEW_ITERATIONS:-3}** iterations (default 3, configurable in Ralph's config.env). If still NEEDS_WORK after max rounds, output `<promise>RETRY</promise>` and stop — let the next Ralph iteration start fresh.

If verdict is NEEDS_WORK:

1. **Parse issues** - Extract ALL issues by severity (Critical → Major → Minor)
2. **Fix the code** - Address each issue in order
3. **Run tests/lints** - Verify fixes don't break anything
4. **Commit fixes** (MANDATORY before re-review):
 ```bash
 git add -A
 git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
 ```
 **If you skip this and re-review without committing changes, reviewer will return NEEDS_WORK again.**

5. **Request re-review** (only AFTER step 4):

 **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT re-add files already in the selection. RepoPrompt auto-refreshes
 file contents on every message. Only use `select-add` for NEW files created during fixes:
 ```bash
 # Only if fixes created new files not in original selection
 if [[ -n "$NEW_FILES" ]]; then
 $FLOWCTL rp select-add --window "$W" --tab "$T" $NEW_FILES
 fi
 ```

 Then send re-review request (NO --new-chat, stay in same chat).

 **CRITICAL: Do NOT summarize fixes.** RP auto-refreshes file contents - reviewer sees your changes automatically. Just request re-review. Any summary wastes tokens and duplicates what reviewer already sees.

 ```bash
 cat > /tmp/re-review.md << 'EOF'
 Issues addressed. Please re-review.

 **REQUIRED**: End with `<verdict>SHIP</verdict>` or `<verdict>NEEDS_WORK</verdict>` or `<verdict>MAJOR_RETHINK</verdict>`
 EOF

 $FLOWCTL rp chat-send --window "$W" --tab "$T" --message-file /tmp/re-review.md
 ```
6. **Repeat** until Ship

**Anti-pattern**: Re-adding already-selected files before re-review. RP auto-refreshes; re-adding can cause issues.

---

## Anti-patterns (RP backend)

- **Calling builder directly** - Must use `setup-review` which wraps it
- **Skipping setup-review** - Window selection MUST happen via this command
- **Hard-coding window IDs** - Never write `--window 1`
- **Missing changed files** - Add ALL changed files to selection
