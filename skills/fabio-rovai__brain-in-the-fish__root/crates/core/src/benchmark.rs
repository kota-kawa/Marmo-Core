This essay argues that while QE was necessary as an emergency measure, its prolonged use has created significant distributional consequences that undermine its net benefit. The Bank of England's own analysis (Haldane, 2014) estimates that QE increased household wealth by £600 billion, but this wealth accrued disproportionately to the top 5% of asset holders. Furthermore, Bernanke (2020) notes that the transmission mechanism from asset prices to real economic activity remains weak.

While traditional analysis focuses on macroeconomic aggregates such as GDP growth and inflation targeting (Svensson, 2003), this essay contends that a comprehensive assessment must incorporate distributional effects. Drawing on Piketty's (2014) framework of capital accumulation, I demonstrate that QE systematically advantages holders of financial assets over wage earners. The Gini coefficient for wealth inequality in the UK increased from 0.62 to 0.68 between 2010 and 2016 (ONS, 2017), a period coinciding with active QE programmes. However, counterfactual analysis by Bunn et al.

In the acute phase (2009-2012), QE served as an effective circuit-breaker: Kapetanios et al. (2012) estimate it prevented a GDP decline of 1.5% and Bridges and Thomas (2012) find it reduced corporate bond spreads by 70-150 basis points. The mechanism operated primarily through the portfolio balance channel rather than the bank lending channel, a finding confirmed across multiple studies (Christensen and Rudebusch, 2012; Joyce et al., 2011). However, the transition from emergency to sustained policy (2012-2022) raises distinct concerns. First, the diminishing marginal returns: each successive round of QE produced smaller yield reductions (Meaning et al., 2017). Second, the financial stability risks from persistently low rates: Turner (2016) argues this fuelled speculative asset bubbles and increased systemic fragility. Third, the fiscal dominance concern: with the Bank holding over 30% of outstanding gilts, the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy became blurred (Goodhart, 2020).".into(),

However, these proxies may reward surface features at the expense of genuine argumentation quality. Perelman (2014) famously demonstrated that nonsensical essays with sophisticated vocabulary received high scores from commercial AES systems. More recent work by Uto et al. (2023) shows that fine-tuned LLMs achieve QWK scores of 0.75-0.85 against human raters, comparable to inter-rater reliability, but this agreement may reflect shared biases rather than valid assessment.
