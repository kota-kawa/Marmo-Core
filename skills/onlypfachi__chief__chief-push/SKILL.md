# /chief-push — Commit & Push

Chief runs your code through every quality gate before anything leaves your machine.
Seven phases. All must pass. Dev approves the version bump, the commit, and the final push.

In Chief's voice at the start:
> "Alright, let's get this pushed. I'm gonna run through the checklist first —
> debug statements, lint, tests, branch setup, version bump — then we'll do the
> commit and push together. Shouldn't take long."

---

## Phase 0: Get the Lay of the Land

```bash
# What's changed
git status --porcelain
git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null
git diff --cached --name-only 2>/dev/null

# Current branch and upstream
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null && echo "HAS_UPSTREAM:yes" || echo "HAS_UPSTREAM:no"

# Developer identity
git config user.name
git config user.email

# Read CHIEF.md for stack context if it exists
[ -f CHIEF.md ] && echo "CHIEF_CONTEXT:yes" || echo "CHIEF_CONTEXT:no"
```

Collect: list of changed files, current branch name, upstream status, developer name.
If CHIEF.md exists, read it for stack context (used for lint suggestion in Phase 2).

---

## Phase 1: Debug Statement Scan

Scan **only the changed files** for debug statements that should not go to production.

```bash
# Get the exact list of changed files (staged + unstaged, exclude deleted)
git diff --name-only HEAD 2>/dev/null
git diff --cached --name-only 2>/dev/null
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard 2>/dev/null
```

For each changed file, scan for these patterns based on file type:

**JavaScript / TypeScript (`.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.mjs`):**
```bash
grep -n "console\.log\|console\.debug\|console\.warn\|console\.error\|console\.info\|debugger\s*;" <file>
```

**PHP / Laravel (`.php`):**
```bash
grep -n "\bdd(\|dump(\|var_dump(\|print_r(\|ray(" <file>
```

**Python (`.py`):**
```bash
grep -n "breakpoint()\|pdb\.set_trace()\|ipdb\.set_trace()\|import pdb\|import ipdb" <file>
# Also flag bare print() calls if not in a script context (main block)
grep -n "^\s*print(" <file>
```

**Ruby (`.rb`):**
```bash
grep -n "\bbinding\.pry\b\|\bbyebug\b\|\brequire ['\"]pry['\"]" <file>
# Also flag debugging pp/p calls
grep -n "^\s*\bpp\b\|^\s*\bp\b " <file>
```

**Go (`.go`):**
```bash
grep -n "fmt\.Println\|fmt\.Printf\|fmt\.Print\|log\.Print" <file>
# Only flag in non-main packages — ask if it's intentional
```

**Rust (`.rs`):**
```bash
grep -n "\bdbg!(" <file>
```

**All files — universal flags:**
```bash
grep -n "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|TEMP\|REMOVEME\|DO NOT COMMIT" <file>
```

**If debug statements are found:**

Show them clearly — file, line number, the actual line:
```
Found debug statements in changed files:

src/auth/login.ts:42    console.log('user object:', user)
src/auth/login.ts:87    debugger;
src/utils/helpers.py:15  print(response.json())
```

Then ask via AskUserQuestion in Chief's voice:
> "Found [N] debug statement(s) in your changed files. These shouldn't go to production.
>
> A) Remove them for me — I'll clean them up now
> B) I'll remove them myself — pause while I do it
> C) Keep [specific ones] — they're intentional (tell me which)
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A — takes 10 seconds and keeps the history clean."

If A: remove them, show what was removed, confirm with the developer.
If B: wait. When the developer says "done", re-run the scan to confirm they're gone.
If C: mark the flagged lines as intentional and skip them in future checks. Continue.

**If no debug statements found:**
> "No debug statements. Clean." → proceed to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Lint

Check if the project has a linter configured.

```bash
# JavaScript / TypeScript
ls eslint.config.* .eslintrc .eslintrc.js .eslintrc.json .eslintrc.yml .eslintrc.yaml 2>/dev/null
ls biome.json 2>/dev/null

# Python
ls .flake8 .pylintrc pyproject.toml setup.cfg 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "flake8\|pylint\|ruff" 2>/dev/null

# Ruby
ls .rubocop.yml .rubocop.json 2>/dev/null

# Go
which golangci-lint 2>/dev/null

# Rust
# Clippy is built-in, check if it's configured
ls clippy.toml .clippy.toml 2>/dev/null
```

### If linter found — run it on changed files only

Get the list of changed files and run the linter scoped to them where possible:

**ESLint:**
```bash
npx eslint --no-eslintrc -c .eslintrc* $(git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$' | tr '\n' ' ')
# Or with config detection:
npx eslint $(git diff --name-only HEAD | grep -E '\.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$' | tr '\n' ' ')
```

**Biome:**
```bash
npx biome check $(git diff --name-only HEAD | tr '\n' ' ')
```

**Ruff (Python):**
```bash
ruff check $(git diff --name-only HEAD | grep '\.py$' | tr '\n' ' ')
```

**Rubocop:**
```bash
bundle exec rubocop $(git diff --name-only HEAD | grep '\.rb$' | tr '\n' ' ')
```

**Go:**
```bash
golangci-lint run $(git diff --name-only HEAD | grep '\.go$' | tr '\n' ' ')
```

**Clippy (Rust):**
```bash
cargo clippy 2>&1
```

**If lint passes:** > "Lint clean." → proceed to Phase 3.

**If lint has auto-fixable errors:**
> "Lint found [N] issues — [M] can be auto-fixed.
> A) Fix them — run the auto-fixer now
> B) Show me the errors — I want to fix them myself
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A."

If A: run the auto-fixer (`--fix`, `--write`, `rubocop -A`, etc.), show the diff, continue.
If B: show all errors with file:line, wait for developer to fix, re-run lint to confirm clean.

**If lint has errors that can't be auto-fixed:**
Show them clearly. Chief does NOT push with lint errors.
> "These need to be fixed manually before we can push. Fix them and run `/chief-push` again."
STOP.

---

### If NO linter found — suggest one

Chief does not push without a linter check. Suggest the right one based on the stack.

**Suggest based on detected stack** (from CHIEF.md or file detection):

| Stack | Recommendation | Why |
|-------|---------------|-----|
| TypeScript / Next.js | ESLint + `@typescript-eslint` + Prettier | Industry standard, best TS support |
| JavaScript (Node API) | ESLint + `eslint-config-node` | Standard for Node projects |
| JavaScript (React SPA) | ESLint + `eslint-plugin-react` + Prettier | Standard for React |
| Python | Ruff | Fastest, modern, replaces flake8+isort+black in one tool |
| Ruby / Rails | RuboCop | The standard, no competition |
| Go | golangci-lint | Wraps all major Go linters |
| Rust | Clippy (built-in) | Ships with Rust, just needs enabling |
| PHP | PHP_CodeSniffer or PHP-CS-Fixer | PSR-12 compliance |

Ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "No linter found. I'd recommend [tool] for this stack — [one sentence why].
>
> A) Set it up now — I'll install and configure it, then lint the changes
> B) Skip lint this time — I know what I'm doing
> C) Use a different linter — tell me which one
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A. Takes 2 minutes and every push after this is covered."

If A: install and configure the recommended linter, run it on the changed files, continue.
If B: skip lint, note it in the push summary. Continue.
If C: install and configure the developer's choice, run it, continue.

---

## Phase 3: Tests

Run the project's test suite.

```bash
# Read test command from CHIEF.md if available, or detect
[ -f CHIEF.md ] && grep -A2 "Testing\|Test command\|test:" CHIEF.md 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Detect test runner
[ -f package.json ] && cat package.json | grep -A3 '"test"' 2>/dev/null
[ -f .rspec ] && echo "RUNNER:rspec"
ls pytest.ini pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "pytest" 2>/dev/null && echo "RUNNER:pytest"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNNER:go test"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNNER:cargo test"
```

Run the full test suite. Stream output so the developer sees progress.

**If tests pass:**
> "Tests passed. ✓" → proceed to Phase 4.

**If tests fail:**
Show the failing tests clearly — test name, file, what failed.

Chief does NOT push with failing tests. Full stop.

> "Tests are failing. These need to be fixed before we push — broken tests in the
> repo are a problem for the whole team.
>
> A) Help me debug them — walk me through what's failing
> B) I'll fix them myself — pause and let me work
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A — let's figure out what broke."

If A: dig into the failing tests, help the developer understand the failure (not fix the code —
use the coaching mode — explain what's failing and why, then let them fix it).
If B: wait. When the developer says "fixed", re-run tests. Don't proceed until green.

**If no test framework found:**
> "No tests detected. Pushing without tests is risky — especially for a team.
>
> A) Set up a test framework now (I'll suggest the right one)
> B) Push anyway — I know there are no tests
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A. You can run `/chief-init` to get the full setup."

If A: hand off to the test bootstrap flow (same as in `/ship`) then continue.
If B: proceed, note "no tests" in the push summary.

---

## Phase 4: Branch Check

```bash
git branch --show-current
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_UPSTREAM"
git config user.name

# Check if there is an open PR on this branch
gh pr view --json number,title,state 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_PR"
```

Collect: current branch name, upstream status, developer name, and whether an open PR exists.

**Check 1: Is the developer on main/master?**

If the current branch is `main`, `master`, `develop`, or `trunk`:
> "Hold on — you're on `[branch]`. Pushing directly to [branch] is risky.
> For this kind of change I'd strongly suggest a feature branch.
>
> A) Create a feature branch now (I'll name it right)
> B) Push to [branch] anyway — I know what I'm doing
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A."

If A: proceed to branch creation below.
If B: note it, continue.

**Check 2: Does the branch have an upstream?**

If `NO_UPSTREAM`:
> "This branch doesn't have an upstream yet. Need to create one before pushing.
> I'll set it up when we push: `git push -u origin [branch]`"

Note this — Chief will use `-u` flag on the push in Phase 6.

**Check 3: Does the branch name reflect the work? (only if NO open PR)**

If an open PR exists on this branch — **skip this check entirely**. The branch is already
public and tied to a PR; renaming it now would break the PR and confuse reviewers.

If there is NO open PR: look at the changed files and the diff. If the current branch name
is generic (`fix`, `update`, `changes`, `dev`, `test`, a ticket number with no description,
or clearly doesn't match the actual changes), act immediately — don't just suggest:

> "Branch name is `[current-name]` but looking at what you changed, this is about
> [inferred topic]. I'm going to create a matching branch.
>
> Suggested: `[developer-name]/[what-was-worked-on]`
>
> A) Create that branch — move my work there now
> B) Give it a different name — I'll tell you what to call it
> C) Keep `[current-name]` — it's fine
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A. A branch name is how the team knows what's inside."

**Branch naming convention:**
```
[developer-name]/[what-the-developer-worked-on]
```
- `developer-name`: from `git config user.name`, lowercase, spaces → hyphens
  (e.g. "John Doe" → `john-doe`)
- `what-the-developer-worked-on`: inferred from the diff, present tense, kebab-case,
  short and descriptive (e.g. `add-user-authentication`, `fix-payment-timeout`,
  `refactor-api-error-handling`)

If A or B (new branch name approved):
```bash
# Create a new branch at the current HEAD — all commits come with it
git checkout -b [new-name]

# If the old branch had a remote tracking branch, offer to delete it
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null
```

If the old branch had an upstream, ask:
> "Old remote branch `origin/[old-name]` still exists. Want me to delete it?
> A) Delete it — it's been replaced
> B) Leave it — I'll handle it later"

If A: `git push origin --delete [old-name]`
If B: note it, continue on the new branch.

---

## Phase 4.5: Version Bump

First, read versioning config from CHIEF.md and detect current version:

```bash
# Read versioning section from CHIEF.md
[ -f CHIEF.md ] && grep -A10 "^## Versioning" CHIEF.md 2>/dev/null

# Read current version from all known version files
cat VERSION 2>/dev/null && echo "---VERSION_FILE:VERSION"
node -e "const p=require('./package.json'); if(p.version) console.log('package.json: '+p.version)" 2>/dev/null
grep -E '^version\s*=' pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null && echo "---VERSION_FILE:pyproject.toml"
grep -E '^version\s*=' Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null && echo "---VERSION_FILE:Cargo.toml"
```

From the output above, determine:
- **Current version** (prefer CHIEF.md `Version files` list, then fall back to what's detected above)
- **Which files need to be updated** on a bump

Show the developer the current version and ask via AskUserQuestion:

> "Current version: **v{current}**. This push needs a version bump.
>
> A) patch — bug fixes, small tweaks (v{current} → v{patch+1})
> B) minor — new features, backwards-compatible (v{current} → v{minor+1}.0)
> C) major — breaking changes (v{current} → v{major+1}.0.0)
> D) Skip — already bumped or this is docs/chore only
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A for most pushes. Only skip if you already bumped the version or the commit is docs/chore with zero user-facing change."

**If A, B, or C:** run the bump script:

```bash
# Detect script location
_CHIEF_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
_BUMP_SCRIPT=""
[ -x "$_CHIEF_ROOT/bin/chief-bump-version" ] && _BUMP_SCRIPT="$_CHIEF_ROOT/bin/chief-bump-version"
[ -z "$_BUMP_SCRIPT" ] && [ -x "$HOME/.claude/skills/chief/bin/chief-bump-version" ] && _BUMP_SCRIPT="$HOME/.claude/skills/chief/bin/chief-bump-version"

# Guard — bail out with an actionable message if script not found
if [ -z "$_BUMP_SCRIPT" ]; then
  echo "Error: chief-bump-version not found. Run ./setup in your chief install directory to build it." >&2
  exit 1
fi

# Run with the chosen bump type (patch / minor / major)
"$_BUMP_SCRIPT" patch   # replace 'patch' with minor or major as appropriate
```

After the script runs, verify all version files listed in CHIEF.md `Version files` were updated:

```bash
# Confirm each version file reflects the new version
# (check each file listed in CHIEF.md Versioning section)
cat VERSION 2>/dev/null
node -e "const p=require('./package.json'); console.log('package.json:', p.version)" 2>/dev/null
grep -E '^version' pyproject.toml 2>/dev/null
grep -E '^version' Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null
```

If any listed version file was NOT updated by the bump script, update it manually to match the new version before continuing.

Show the result: "Bumped to v{new version}." Then include all updated version files in the files to be staged in Phase 5.

**If D (skip):** Ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "Got it — quick reason for skipping?
>
> A) Already bumped — version is current
> B) Docs / chore only — no user-facing change
> C) Hotfix config — bump is not applicable here
> D) Other — I'll explain in the commit message"

Accept the selection, note it in the summary, and continue. Do not stage version files unless they were already changed.

---

## Phase 5: Commit

**Stage the changes:**

```bash
git status --porcelain
git diff --stat HEAD 2>/dev/null
```

Show the developer what's about to be staged:
```
Ready to commit:
  modified: src/auth/login.ts
  modified: src/utils/helpers.py
  new file: src/auth/types.ts
```

Ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "Stage everything above?
>
> A) Yes — all of it
> B) No — I need to leave something out (I'll tell you which)"

If A: `git add` all changed files.
If B: ask the developer which files to skip, then `git add` selectively.

**Generate the commit message:**

Analyze the diff and generate a commit message following conventional commits format:

```
Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>

Types:
  feat     — new feature for the user
  fix      — bug fix for the user
  docs     — changes to documentation only
  style    — formatting, missing semicolons (no logic change)
  refactor — refactoring code (no feature or bug change)
  test     — adding or fixing tests only
  chore    — build process, dependencies, tooling

Rules:
  - Subject in present tense ("add" not "added")
  - Subject lowercase, no period at end
  - Scope is optional — use it when the change is scoped to a specific module
  - Keep subject under 72 characters
  - If the change touches multiple types, pick the most significant one
```

Examples of good messages generated from diffs:
- `feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation`
- `fix(payments): handle timeout on Stripe webhook retry`
- `refactor(api): extract error handling into middleware`
- `test(auth): add coverage for login edge cases`
- `chore: upgrade Prisma to v5.8`

Present the suggested message in Chief's voice:
> "Here's the commit message I'd go with:
>
> `[generated message]`
>
> A) That's good — use it
> B) Edit it — I'll tweak the message
> C) Write my own — I'll give you the message
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A unless you see something off."

Do NOT commit until the developer approves the message.

Once approved:
```bash
git commit -m "[approved message]"
```

Show the commit hash after it's made.

---

## Phase 6: Push

Present the final summary before pushing — this is the last checkpoint:

```
Ready to push:

  Branch:   [branch-name] → origin/[branch-name]
  Commit:   [hash] [commit message]
  Files:    [N] changed, [X] insertions, [Y] deletions

  Debug scan:  ✓ clean
  Lint:        ✓ passed (or "⚠ skipped")
  Tests:       ✓ [N] passed (or "⚠ no tests")
```

Ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "Everything looks good. Ready to push?
>
> A) Push it
> B) Hold on — I want to check something first"

If A:
```bash
# With upstream already set
git push

# If no upstream (first push of this branch)
git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

Show the push output. If push succeeds, Chief wraps up in its voice:
> "Pushed. You're live on [branch]. Nice work."

If push fails (rejected, conflicts, auth):
Show the error clearly. Help the developer understand what went wrong.
Common cases:
- Rejected (non-fast-forward): "Remote has commits you don't have — pull first, then push."
  Run `git pull --rebase` if approved.
- Auth failure: "Git credentials issue — check your SSH key or token."
- Protected branch: "This branch is protected — you'll need a PR instead of a direct push."

---

## Push Summary

After every run (success or failure), output a clean summary:

```
/chief-push summary
───────────────────────────────────────
Branch:      john-doe/add-user-auth
Commit:      a3f92b1 feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation
Files:       4 changed, 127 insertions, 12 deletions

Phase 1 — Debug scan:   ✓ 2 statements removed
Phase 2 — Lint:         ✓ 0 errors
Phase 3 — Tests:        ✓ 47 passed, 0 failed
Phase 4 — Branch:       ✓ upstream set (or "✓ created [new-name] — matched to work")
Phase 4.5 — Version:    ✓ bumped to v0.8.6 (or "⚠ skipped — [reason]")
Phase 5 — Commit:       ✓ conventional commit
Phase 6 — Push:         ✓ pushed to origin

Status: DONE
───────────────────────────────────────
```

---

## Important Rules

- **Never push with failing tests.** Tests failing = the code is broken. Full stop.
- **Never push with lint errors.** Lint errors = the code doesn't meet the project standard.
- **Never skip the debug scan.** `console.log` in production is embarrassing at best,
  a security issue at worst.
- **Dev approves the commit message.** Always. No silent commits.
- **Dev approves the final push.** Always. The push summary is the last checkpoint.
- **No upfront gate.** Chief starts immediately — no "sound good?" prompt. Dev time is spent on decisions, not confirmations.
- **Each phase is a hard gate.** A failure in any phase stops everything. No skipping
  ahead to commit anyway.
