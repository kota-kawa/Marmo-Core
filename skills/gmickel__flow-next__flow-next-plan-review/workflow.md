# Plan Review Workflow

## CRITICAL: RepoPrompt Commands Are SLOW - DO NOT RETRY

**READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING ANY COMMANDS:**

1. **`setup-review` takes 5-15 MINUTES** - It runs the RepoPrompt context builder which indexes files. This is NORMAL. Do NOT assume it is stuck.

2. **`chat-send` takes 2-10 MINUTES** - It waits for the LLM to generate a full review. This is NORMAL. Do NOT assume it is stuck.

3. **Run commands directly and WAIT** - Do NOT use background jobs. Just run the command and wait:
 ```bash
 # Run setup-review - takes 5-15 minutes, just wait
 $FLOWCTL rp setup-review --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --summary "..."
 # You will see file paths printed as it indexes - this is progress, not errors
 ```

4. **Output is progress, not errors** - The context builder prints file paths as it indexes. Seeing many lines of output is NORMAL. Do not interpret this as an error loop.

5. **NEVER retry these commands** - If you run them again, you will create duplicate reviews and waste time. Run ONCE and WAIT.

6. **Exit code 0 = success** - When the command finishes, check the exit code. If it is 0, it worked.

**If a command has been running for less than 15 minutes, WAIT. Do not retry. Do not output <promise>RETRY</promise>.**

---

## Philosophy

The reviewer model only sees selected files. RepoPrompt's Builder discovers context you'd miss (rp backend). Codex and Copilot use context hints from flowctl (codex/copilot backends).

---

## Phase 0: Backend Detection

**Run this first. Do not skip.**

**CRITICAL: flowctl is BUNDLED — NOT installed globally.** `which flowctl` will fail (expected). Always use:

```bash
set -e
FLOWCTL="$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl"
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"

# Priority: --review flag > env > config (flag parsed in SKILL.md)
# Text output is bare backend name for back-compat grep. --json returns full
# resolved spec (backend, spec, model, effort, source).
BACKEND=$($FLOWCTL review-backend)

if [[ "$BACKEND" == "ASK" ]]; then
 echo "Error: No review backend configured."
 echo "Run /flow-next:setup to configure, or pass --review=rp|codex|copilot|none"
 exit 1
fi

echo "Review backend: $BACKEND (override: --review=rp|codex|copilot|none)"
```

**Spec-form env var (optional):** `FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND` accepts bare or full spec:

```bash
FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND=codex:gpt-5.5:xhigh $FLOWCTL codex plan-review "$SPEC_ID" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH"
FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND=copilot:claude-opus-4.5 $FLOWCTL copilot plan-review "$SPEC_ID" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH"
# Or pass spec directly:
$FLOWCTL codex plan-review "$SPEC_ID" --spec "codex:gpt-5.5:xhigh" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH"
```

Per-spec `default_review` (set via `flowctl spec set-backend`) overrides env.

**If backend is "none"**: Skip review, inform user, and exit cleanly (no error).

**Then branch to backend-specific workflow below.**

---

## Codex Backend Workflow

Use when `BACKEND="codex"`.

### Step 0: Save Checkpoint

**Before review** (protects against context compaction):
```bash
SPEC_ID="${1:-}"
$FLOWCTL checkpoint save --spec "$SPEC_ID" --json
```

### Step 1: Execute Review

```bash
RECEIPT_PATH="${REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH:-/tmp/plan-review-receipt.json}"

# --files: comma-separated CODE files for reviewer context
# Spec/task specs are auto-included; pass files the plan will CREATE or MODIFY
# Read spec to identify affected paths, then list key files
CODE_FILES="src/main.py,src/config.py" # Customize per spec

$FLOWCTL codex plan-review "$SPEC_ID" --files "$CODE_FILES" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH"
```

**Output includes `VERDICT=SHIP|NEEDS_WORK|MAJOR_RETHINK`.**

### Step 2: Update Status

```bash
# Based on verdict
$FLOWCTL spec set-plan-review-status "$SPEC_ID" --status ship --json
# OR
$FLOWCTL spec set-plan-review-status "$SPEC_ID" --status needs_work --json
```

### Step 3: Handle Verdict

If `VERDICT=NEEDS_WORK`:
1. Parse issues from output
2. Fix plan via `$FLOWCTL spec set-plan`
3. Re-run step 1 (receipt enables session continuity)
4. Repeat until SHIP

### Step 4: Receipt

Receipt is written automatically by `flowctl codex plan-review` when `--receipt` provided.
Format: `{"type":"plan_review","id":"<spec-id>","mode":"codex","verdict":"<verdict>","session_id":"<thread_id>","timestamp":"..."}`

---

## Copilot Backend Workflow

Use when `BACKEND="copilot"`.

### Step 0: Save Checkpoint

**Before review** (protects against context compaction):
```bash
SPEC_ID="${1:-}"
$FLOWCTL checkpoint save --spec "$SPEC_ID" --json
```

### Step 1: Execute Review

```bash
RECEIPT_PATH="${REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH:-/tmp/plan-review-receipt.json}"

# --files: comma-separated CODE files for reviewer context
# Spec/task specs are auto-included; pass files the plan will CREATE or MODIFY
CODE_FILES="src/main.py,src/config.py" # Customize per spec

# Runtime config:
# --spec <spec> full spec (backend:model:effort), highest priority
# FLOW_REVIEW_BACKEND spec-form ok: copilot:claude-opus-4.5:xhigh
# FLOW_COPILOT_MODEL fills missing model only (default gpt-5.2)
# FLOW_COPILOT_EFFORT fills missing effort only (default high)

$FLOWCTL copilot plan-review "$SPEC_ID" --files "$CODE_FILES" --receipt "$RECEIPT_PATH"
```

**Output includes `VERDICT=SHIP|NEEDS_WORK|MAJOR_RETHINK`.**

### Step 2: Update Status

```bash
# Based on verdict
$FLOWCTL spec set-plan-review-status "$SPEC_ID" --status ship --json
# OR
$FLOWCTL spec set-plan-review-status "$SPEC_ID" --status needs_work --json
```

### Step 3: Handle Verdict

If `VERDICT=NEEDS_WORK`:
1. Parse issues from output
2. Fix plan via `$FLOWCTL spec set-plan`
3. Re-run step 1 (receipt enables session continuity when `mode == "copilot"`)
4. Repeat until SHIP

### Step 4: Receipt

Receipt is written automatically by `flowctl copilot plan-review` when `--receipt` provided.
Format: `{"type":"plan_review","id":"<spec-id>","mode":"copilot","verdict":"<verdict>","session_id":"<uuid>","model":"<model>","effort":"<effort>","spec":"copilot:<model>:<effort>","timestamp":"..."}`

The `spec` field is the canonical round-trippable form (added in fn-28.3). `model` + `effort` remain for backward compatibility.

Session resume guard: re-review only resumes the copilot session when the existing receipt at `$RECEIPT_PATH` has `mode == "copilot"`. Cross-backend switches start a fresh session.

---

## RepoPrompt Backend Workflow

Use when `BACKEND="rp"`.

## Phase 1: Read the Plan (RP)

**Run this BEFORE setup-review so the builder gets a real summary.**

**If Flow issue:**
```bash
$FLOWCTL show <id> --json
$FLOWCTL cat <id>
```

Save output for inclusion in review prompt. Compose a 1-2 sentence `REVIEW_SUMMARY` for the setup-review command below.

**Save checkpoint** (protects against context compaction during review):
```bash
$FLOWCTL checkpoint save --spec <id> --json
```
This creates `.flow/.checkpoint-<id>.json` with full state. If compaction occurs during review-fix cycles, restore with `$FLOWCTL checkpoint restore --spec <id>`.

---

### Atomic Setup Block

**Only run ONCE. Uses the summary composed in Phase 1.**

```bash
# Atomic: pick-window + builder (uses REVIEW_SUMMARY from Phase 1)
eval "$($FLOWCTL rp setup-review --repo-root "$REPO_ROOT" --summary "$REVIEW_SUMMARY" --create)"

# Verify we have W and T
if [[ -z "${W:-}" || -z "${T:-}" ]]; then
 echo "<promise>RETRY</promise>"
 exit 0
fi

echo "Setup complete: W=$W T=$T"
```

If this block fails, output `<promise>RETRY</promise>` and stop. Do not improvise.
**Do NOT re-run setup-review** — the builder runs inside it. Re-running = double context build.

---

## Phase 2: Augment Selection (RP)

Builder selects context automatically. Review and add must-haves:

```bash
# See what builder selected
$FLOWCTL rp select-get --window "$W" --tab "$T"

# Always add the spec
$FLOWCTL rp select-add --window "$W" --tab "$T" .flow/specs/<spec-id>.md

# Always add ALL task specs for this spec
for task_spec in .flow/tasks/${SPEC_ID}.*.md; do
 [[ -f "$task_spec" ]] && $FLOWCTL rp select-add --window "$W" --tab "$T" "$task_spec"
done

# Add PRD/architecture docs if found
$FLOWCTL rp select-add --window "$W" --tab "$T" docs/prd.md
```

**Why this matters:** Chat only sees selected files. Reviewer needs both spec AND task specs to check for consistency.

---

## Phase 3: Execute Review (RP)

### Build combined prompt

Get builder's handoff:
```bash
HANDOFF="$($FLOWCTL rp prompt-get --window "$W" --tab "$T")"
```

Write combined prompt:
```bash
cat > /tmp/review-prompt.md << 'EOF'
[PASTE HANDOFF HERE]

---

## IMPORTANT: File Contents
RepoPrompt includes the actual source code of selected files in a `<file_contents>` XML section at the end of this message. You MUST:
1. Locate the `<file_contents>` section
2. Read and analyze the actual source code within it
3. Base your review on the code, not summaries or descriptions

If you cannot find `<file_contents>`, ask for the files to be re-attached before proceeding.

## Plan Under Review
[PASTE flowctl show OUTPUT]

## Review Focus
[USER'S FOCUS AREAS]

## Review Scope

You are reviewing:
1. **Spec** - The high-level plan
2. **Task specs** - Individual task breakdowns

**CRITICAL**: Check for consistency between spec and tasks. Flag if:
- Task specs contradict or miss spec requirements
- Task acceptance criteria don't align with spec acceptance criteria
- Task approaches would need to change based on spec design decisions
- Spec mentions states/enums/types that tasks don't account for

## Review Criteria

Conduct a John Carmack-level review:

1. **Completeness** - All requirements covered? Missing edge cases?
2. **Feasibility** - Technically sound? Dependencies clear?
3. **Parallelizability** - Do independent tasks touch disjoint files? Flag overlapping file scopes that will cause merge conflicts.
4. **Clarity** - Specs unambiguous? Acceptance criteria testable?
5. **Architecture** - Right abstractions? Clean boundaries?
6. **Risks** - Blockers identified? Security gaps? Mitigation?
7. **Scope** - Right-sized? Over/under-engineering?
8. **Task sizing** - M tasks preferred. Flag over-splitting: 7+ tasks? Sequential S tasks that should be combined?
9. **Testability** - How will we verify this works?
10. **Consistency** - Do task specs align with spec?
11. **Vocabulary** - [Include ONLY when `flowctl glossary list --json` reports `total_terms > 0`: "Canonical vocabulary lives in GLOSSARY.md — flag specs/tasks that contradict defined terms." Omit this line otherwise.]

## Protected artifacts

The following paths are flow-next / project-pipeline artifacts. Any finding recommending their deletion, gitignore, or removal MUST be discarded during synthesis. Do not flag these paths for cleanup under any circumstances:

- `.flow/*` — flow-next state, specs, tasks, runtime
- `.flow/bin/*` — bundled flowctl
- `.flow/memory/*` — learnings store (pitfalls, conventions, decisions)
- `.flow/specs/*.md` — specs (decision artifacts)
- `.flow/tasks/*.md` — task specs (decision artifacts)
- `docs/plans/*` — plan artifacts (if project uses this convention)
- `docs/solutions/*` — solutions artifacts (if project uses this convention)
- `scripts/ralph/*` — Ralph harness (when present)

These files are intentionally committed. They are the pipeline's state, not clutter. An agent that deletes them destroys the project's planning trail and breaks Ralph autonomous runs.

If you notice genuine issues with content INSIDE these files (e.g., a spec that contradicts itself, a stale entry), flag the content — not the file's existence.

**Protected-path filter.** Before emitting findings, scan each for recommendations to delete, gitignore, or `rm -rf` any path matching the protected list above. Drop those findings. If you drop any, report the drop count in a `Protected-path filter:` line in the review output (e.g. `Protected-path filter: dropped 2 findings`). Omit the line when nothing was dropped.

## Output Format

For each issue:
- **Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor / Nitpick
- **Location**: Which task or section (e.g., "fn-1.3 Description" or "Spec Acceptance #2")
- **Problem**: What's wrong
- **Suggestion**: How to fix

After the issues list, emit a `Protected-path filter:` line tallying findings dropped by the protected-path filter (omit when nothing was dropped).

**REQUIRED**: You MUST end your response with exactly one verdict tag. This is mandatory:
`<verdict>SHIP</verdict>` or `<verdict>NEEDS_WORK</verdict>` or `<verdict>MAJOR_RETHINK</verdict>`

Do NOT skip this tag. The automation depends on it.
EOF
```

### Send to RepoPrompt

```bash
REVIEW_RESPONSE="$($FLOWCTL rp chat-send --window "$W" --tab "$T" --message-file /tmp/review-prompt.md --new-chat --chat-name "Plan Review: <SPEC_ID>")"
echo "$REVIEW_RESPONSE"

VERDICT="$(echo "$REVIEW_RESPONSE" \
 | tr -d '\r' \
 | grep -oE '<verdict>(SHIP|NEEDS_WORK|MAJOR_RETHINK)</verdict>' \
 | tail -n 1 \
 | sed -E 's#</?verdict>##g')"

if [[ -z "$VERDICT" ]]; then
 echo "No verdict tag found in response"
 echo "<promise>RETRY</promise>"
 exit 0
fi
```

**WAIT** for response. Takes 1-5+ minutes.

---

## Phase 4: Receipt + Status (RP)

### Write receipt (if REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH set)

```bash
if [[ -n "${REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH:-}" ]]; then
 ts="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
 mkdir -p "$(dirname "$REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH")"
 cat > "$REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH" <<EOF
{"type":"plan_review","id":"<SPEC_ID>","mode":"rp","verdict":"$VERDICT","timestamp":"$ts"}
EOF
 echo "REVIEW_RECEIPT_WRITTEN: $REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH"
fi
```

### Update status

```bash
# If SHIP
$FLOWCTL spec set-plan-review-status <SPEC_ID> --status ship --json

# If NEEDS_WORK or MAJOR_RETHINK
$FLOWCTL spec set-plan-review-status <SPEC_ID> --status needs_work --json
```

If no verdict tag, output `<promise>RETRY</promise>` and stop.

---

## Fix Loop (RP)

**CRITICAL: Do NOT ask user for confirmation. Automatically fix ALL valid issues and re-review — our goal is production-grade world-class software and architecture. Never use the plain-text numbered prompt in this loop.**

**CRITICAL: You MUST fix the plan BEFORE re-reviewing. Never re-review without making changes.**

If verdict is NEEDS_WORK:

1. **Parse issues** - Extract ALL issues by severity (Critical → Major → Minor)
2. **Fix the spec** - Address each issue.
3. **Update spec in flowctl** (MANDATORY before re-review):
 ```bash
 # Option A: stdin heredoc (preferred, no temp file)
 $FLOWCTL spec set-plan <SPEC_ID> --file - --json <<'EOF'
 <updated spec content>
 EOF

 # Option B: temp file (if content has single quotes)
 $FLOWCTL spec set-plan <SPEC_ID> --file /tmp/updated-plan.md --json
 ```
 **If you skip this step and re-review with same content, reviewer will return NEEDS_WORK again.**

 **Recovery**: If context compaction occurred, restore from checkpoint first:
 ```bash
 $FLOWCTL checkpoint restore --spec <SPEC_ID> --json
 ```

4. **Sync affected task specs** - If spec changes affect task specs, update them:
 ```bash
 $FLOWCTL task set-spec <TASK_ID> --file - --json <<'EOF'
 <updated task spec content>
 EOF
 ```
 Task specs need updating when spec changes affect:
 - State/enum values referenced in tasks
 - Acceptance criteria that tasks implement
 - Approach/design decisions tasks depend on
 - Lock/retry/error handling semantics
 - API signatures or type definitions

5. **Request re-review** (only AFTER steps 3-4):

 **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT re-add files already in the selection. RepoPrompt auto-refreshes
 file contents on every message. Only use `select-add` for NEW files created during fixes:
 ```bash
 # Only if fixes created new files not in original selection
 if [[ -n "$NEW_FILES" ]]; then
 $FLOWCTL rp select-add --window "$W" --tab "$T" $NEW_FILES
 fi
 ```

 Then send re-review request (NO --new-chat, stay in same chat).

 **CRITICAL: Do NOT summarize fixes.** RP auto-refreshes file contents - reviewer sees your changes automatically. Just request re-review. Any summary wastes tokens and duplicates what reviewer already sees.

 ```bash
 cat > /tmp/re-review.md << 'EOF'
 Issues addressed. Please re-review.

 **REQUIRED**: End with `<verdict>SHIP</verdict>` or `<verdict>NEEDS_WORK</verdict>` or `<verdict>MAJOR_RETHINK</verdict>`
 EOF

 $FLOWCTL rp chat-send --window "$W" --tab "$T" --message-file /tmp/re-review.md
 ```
6. **Repeat** until Ship

**Anti-pattern**: Re-adding already-selected files before re-review. RP auto-refreshes; re-adding can cause issues.

**Anti-pattern**: Re-reviewing without calling `spec set-plan` first. This wastes reviewer time and loops forever.

**Anti-pattern**: Updating spec without syncing affected task specs. Causes reviewer to flag consistency issues again.

---

## Anti-patterns

**All backends:**
- **Reviewing yourself** - You coordinate; the backend reviews
- **No receipt** - If REVIEW_RECEIPT_PATH is set, you MUST write receipt
- **Ignoring verdict** - Must extract and act on verdict tag
- **Mixing backends** - Stick to one backend for the entire review session

**RP backend only:**
- **Calling builder directly** - Must use `setup-review` which wraps it
- **Skipping setup-review** - Window selection MUST happen via this command
- **Hard-coding window IDs** - Never write `--window 1`

**Codex backend only:**
- **Using `--last` flag** - Conflicts with parallel usage; use `--receipt` instead
- **Direct codex calls** - Must use `flowctl codex` wrappers

**Copilot backend only:**
- **Direct copilot calls** - Must use `flowctl copilot` wrappers
- **Inventing `--model`/`--effort` CLI flags** - Use `--spec` for a full backend:model:effort value, or `FLOW_COPILOT_MODEL` / `FLOW_COPILOT_EFFORT` env vars to fill individual fields
- **Using `--continue`** - Conflicts with parallel usage; session resume uses `--resume=<uuid>` under the hood via `--receipt`
- **Assuming cross-backend session continuity** - Resume only works when prior receipt has `mode == "copilot"`
