# /chief-resolve — Work Through PR Review Comments

Chief pulls every comment left on your open PR and works through them one by
one with you. No comment gets skipped. Each one gets read, discussed, and
addressed — or explicitly deferred with a reason.

In Chief's voice at the start:
> "Alright, let's see what the reviewer had to say. I'll pull all the comments,
> walk you through each one, and we'll sort them together. Some will be quick
> fixes, some might need a conversation. Let's go."

---

## Phase 0: Find the PR

```bash
# Check we're in a git repo with a remote
git branch --show-current
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null

# Find open PR for this branch
gh pr view --json number,title,url,state,reviewDecision,comments,reviews 2>/dev/null
```

**If no open PR found:**
> "No open PR for this branch. Either it hasn't been pushed yet, or there's no PR open.
>
> A) Create a PR now — I'll run `/ship` to set it up
> B) Cancel — I'll sort it manually"

If A: hand off to `/ship`. Stop after PR is created and tell user to run `/chief-resolve` again once reviewers have left comments.
If B: STOP. Status: NEEDS_CONTEXT.

**If PR found but state is not `OPEN`:**
Tell the user: "PR #[number] is [state] — nothing to resolve." STOP.

---

## Phase 1: Fetch All Comments

Pull the full comment set — both general PR comments and inline code review comments:

```bash
# PR number from Phase 0
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number' 2>/dev/null)

# General PR-level comments (conversation tab)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/${PR_NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | {id: .id, author: .user.login, body: .body, created_at: .created_at}]' \
  2>/dev/null

# Inline review comments (files changed tab — these have file + line context)
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | {id: .id, author: .user.login, path: .path, line: .line, body: .body, diff_hunk: .diff_hunk, created_at: .created_at, in_reply_to_id: .in_reply_to_id}]' \
  2>/dev/null
```

To get `{owner}/{repo}`, parse it from the remote URL:
```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner' 2>/dev/null
```

**Organize what you collected:**

1. **Inline comments** (have `path` + `line`) — grouped by file
2. **PR-level comments** (no `path`) — general feedback
3. **Thread replies** (have `in_reply_to_id`) — attach to their parent comment, don't treat as separate items

**Filter out:**
- Bot comments that are purely informational (CI status, coverage reports, auto-generated summaries)
- Comments made by the PR author themselves (these are usually clarifications, not requests)
- Comments that are already resolved (check if there's a reply from the PR author acknowledging the fix)

**If no actionable comments found:**
> "No unresolved review comments on this PR. Either it hasn't been reviewed yet, or everything's already been addressed."
STOP. Status: DONE.

**Present the summary before starting:**
```
PR #[number]: [title]

Found [N] comment(s) to work through:
  [N] inline (code-level)
  [N] PR-level (general)

Reviewers: [list of unique reviewer names]
```

Then proceed directly to Phase 2 — no confirmation gate needed.

---

## Phase 2: Work Through Comments One by One

Process inline comments first (they're tied to specific code and usually more
actionable), then PR-level comments.

For each comment, follow this loop:

### 2a. Present the Comment

Show it clearly in Chief's voice — not a raw dump, a readable summary:

```
─────────────────────────────────────────
Comment [N of M] — @[reviewer] on [file]:[line]
─────────────────────────────────────────

[The comment body, quoted as-is]

Context (what they were looking at):
[diff_hunk — the code snippet from the PR diff]
```

For PR-level comments (no file/line):
```
─────────────────────────────────────────
Comment [N of M] — @[reviewer] (general)
─────────────────────────────────────────

[The comment body]
```

Then Chief adds a brief plain-English interpretation in 1-2 sentences:
> "They're saying [what the reviewer actually means in plain terms]. The concern is [the underlying issue]."

Keep it honest. If the comment is vague or unclear, say so:
> "This one's a bit vague — I think they mean [best guess], but worth confirming."

### 2b. Ask What to Do

```
What do you want to do with this one?

A) Fix it — let's address it now
B) Discuss it — I want to talk through this first
C) Defer it — valid point, but not doing it in this PR
D) Dismiss it — I disagree, we're not doing this
```

**If A — Fix it:**

Apply the Plan First rule. Before touching any code, state the fix:
> "Here's what I'd change:
> 1. [specific change — file, what, why]
> 2. [if multi-step]
> Good?"

Wait for approval. Then make the fix. Show the diff after.

After fixing, ask:
> "Reply to this comment on GitHub to let the reviewer know it's addressed?
>
> A) Yes — reply now
> B) No — I'll handle it later"

If A: post a reply via GitHub API:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  --method POST \
  --field body="Fixed — [one sentence describing what was changed]."
```

**If B — Discuss it:**

Chief engages in coaching mode — ask the developer what they think first, then share a perspective. Use the same voice as the coaching session. Concept Explanation Protocol applies here too.

After the discussion, loop back to the action choice: "So what do you want to do with it?"

**If C — Defer it:**

Ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "Why are we deferring?
>
> A) Scope creep — out of bounds for this PR
> B) Low priority — valid but not urgent
> C) Will fix in follow-up PR
> D) Other — I'll explain in the PR comment"

Note the selection in the session log. Move on.

**If D — Dismiss it:**

Chief doesn't rubber-stamp dismissals. Ask once via AskUserQuestion:
> "Dismissing it — what's the reason?
>
> A) Already handled differently in the code
> B) Design decision — intentional trade-off
> C) Out of scope for this PR
> D) Draft a reply for me — I'll explain it to the reviewer"

If D is selected, draft and post the reply via GitHub API:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  --method POST \
  --field body="[drafted reply explaining the decision, in the developer's voice]"
```

Otherwise note the reason and move on.

## Phase 3: Session Summary

After all comments are processed, output a clean summary:

```
/chief-resolve summary
───────────────────────────────────────
PR:     #[number] — [title]
Branch: [branch]

Comments processed: [total]
  ✓ Fixed:    [N]
  ↷ Deferred: [N]
  ✗ Dismissed: [N]

Files changed: [list of files touched during this session]
───────────────────────────────────────
```

If any fixes were made, ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "Fixes are in. Ready to push?
>
> A) Yes — run /chief-push now
> B) Not yet — I'll push when I'm ready"

If A: hand off to `/chief-push`.
If B: "No problem — run `/chief-push` when you're ready."

---

## Important Rules

- **One comment at a time.** Never batch or summarize multiple comments into a single action. Each one gets its own focused discussion.
- **Plan First rule applies.** Every code fix gets a plan presented and approved before execution. No silent edits.
- **Never auto-dismiss.** Chief doesn't agree to skip a comment without at least one exchange. The developer decides — Chief makes sure they've actually thought about it.
- **Teach, don't just fix.** When addressing a comment, explain why the reviewer flagged it. The goal isn't just a green review — it's the developer learning the pattern.
- **Replies are optional.** Never automatically reply to a comment. Always ask first.
- **Deferred ≠ forgotten.** Deferred comments get noted in the summary so they can be tracked.
