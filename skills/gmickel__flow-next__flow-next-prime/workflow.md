# Flow Prime Workflow

Execute these phases in order. Reference [pillars.md](pillars.md) for scoring criteria and [remediation.md](remediation.md) for fix templates.

**Model guidance**: This skill uses sonnet for synthesis and report generation. Scouts run as sonnet for quality.

---

## Phase 1: Parallel Assessment

Run all 9 scouts in parallel (Codex spawns them as multi-agent threads):

### Agent Readiness Scouts (Pillars 1-5)

```
Use the tooling_scout agent # linters, formatters, pre-commit, type checking
Use the agents_md_scout agent # CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md quality
Use the env_scout agent # .env.example, docker, devcontainer
Use the testing_scout agent # test framework, coverage, commands
Use the build_scout agent # build system, scripts, CI
Use the docs_gap_scout agent # README, ADRs, architecture docs
```

### Production Readiness Scouts (Pillars 6-8)

```
Use the observability_scout agent # logging, tracing, metrics, health
Use the security_scout agent # branch protection, CODEOWNERS, secrets
Use the workflow_scout agent # CI/CD, templates, automation
```

**Important**: Launch all 9 scout agents in parallel for speed (~15-20 seconds total).

Wait for all scouts to complete. Collect findings.

---

## Phase 2: Verification (Optional but Recommended)

After scouts complete, verify key commands actually work.

### Test Verification

If test framework detected by testing-scout, verify tests are runnable using the **appropriate command for the detected framework**.

**Common examples** (adapt to whatever framework is detected):

| Framework | Verification Command |
|-----------|---------------------|
| pytest | `pytest --collect-only` |
| Jest | `npx jest --listTests` |
| Vitest | `npx vitest --run --reporter=dot` |
| Mocha | `npx mocha --dry-run` |
| Go test | `go test ./... -list .` |
| Cargo test | `cargo test --no-run` |
| PHPUnit | `phpunit --list-tests` |

These are examples. For other frameworks, find the equivalent "list tests" or "dry run" command. The goal is to verify tests are discoverable without actually running them.

**For monorepos**: Run verification in each app directory that has tests.

**Adapt to project**: Use the package manager detected (pnpm/npm/yarn/bun). If venv detected for Python, activate it first.

Example:
```bash
# Python with venv
cd apps/api && source .venv/bin/activate && pytest --collect-only 2>&1 | head -20

# JS with pnpm
pnpm test --passWithNoTests 2>&1 | head -10

# Go
go test ./... -list . 2>&1 | head -20
```

Mark TS4 as ✅ only if verification succeeds (tests are discoverable and runnable).

### Build Verification (Quick)

```bash
# Check if build command exists and is valid
pnpm build --help 2>&1 | head -5 || npm run build --help 2>&1 | head -5
```

---

## Phase 3: Score & Synthesize

Read [pillars.md](pillars.md) for pillar definitions and criteria.

### Agent Readiness Score (Pillars 1-5)

For each pillar (1-5):
1. Map scout findings to criteria (pass/fail)
2. Calculate pillar score: `(passed / total) * 100`

Calculate:
- **Agent Readiness Score**: average of Pillars 1-5 scores
- **Maturity Level**: based on thresholds in pillars.md

### Production Readiness Score (Pillars 6-8)

For each pillar (6-8):
1. Map scout findings to criteria (pass/fail)
2. Calculate pillar score: `(passed / total) * 100`

Calculate:
- **Production Readiness Score**: average of Pillars 6-8 scores

### Overall Score

**Overall Score** = average of all 8 pillar scores

### Glossary signal (DC8 — deterministic, no scout)

One bash call decides DC8 — run it during synthesis (no scout covers it):

```bash
FLOWCTL="$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl"
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"
GLOSSARY_TERMS=$("$FLOWCTL" glossary list --json 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.total_terms // 0')
```

Gate on `total_terms == 0`, NEVER on `[[ -f GLOSSARY.md ]]` — `flowctl glossary remove` leaves a `# Glossary` H1 husk after the last term is removed (the file is project state, never deleted), so a presence check false-passes on an empty husk. Same invariant as interview's doc-aware autodetect.

- `GLOSSARY_TERMS > 0` → DC8 ✅. Report term coverage in Phase 4. Never rewrite, never re-propose existing terms — staleness/alias pruning belongs to `/flow-next:audit`, not prime.
- `GLOSSARY_TERMS == 0` (file absent or husk) → DC8 ❌. Phase 5.5 offers the bootstrap.

### Prioritize Recommendations

Generate prioritized recommendations from **Pillars 1-5 only** (excluding informational sub-criteria DC7 and DE7):
1. Critical first (CLAUDE.md, .env.example)
2. High impact second (pre-commit hooks, lint commands)
3. Medium last (build scripts, .gitignore)

**Never offer fixes for Pillars 6-8** — these are informational only.
**Never offer fixes for DC7/DE7** — informational sub-criteria; surface as suggestions in Top Recommendations only.

[Repeat for each pillar]

## Top Recommendations (Agent Readiness)

1. **[Category]**: [specific action] — [why it helps agents]
2. **[Category]**: [specific action] — [why it helps agents]
3. **[Category]**: [specific action] — [why it helps agents]

### Informational suggestions (not scored)

When DE7 fires negative (no `.clawpatch/` or `flowctl repo-map list --count` returns 0), append this line to Top Recommendations:

> Consider: `/flow-next:map` — builds a semantic feature index for richer scope anchoring (optional).

Detection — `flowctl` is **bundled, not on `PATH`** after install, so use the same `FLOWCTL` prelude pattern as the other skills (canonical Droid+Claude fallback; sync-codex.sh rewrites it to `$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl` for the Codex mirror):

```bash
FLOWCTL="$HOME/.codex/scripts/flowctl"
[ -x "$FLOWCTL" ] || FLOWCTL=".flow/bin/flowctl"
[[ -d .clawpatch ]] && [ "$("$FLOWCTL" repo-map list --count 2>/dev/null)" -gt 0 ]
```

DE7 is informational — surface as a suggestion only; do NOT include it in Phase 5 remediation prompts.

Glossary (DC8) lines — driven by the Phase 3 glossary signal:

- When `GLOSSARY_TERMS == 0`, append:

 > GLOSSARY.md is absent or a husk — Phase 5.5 offers to seed it from the repo (read-back gated). Under `--report-only`, re-run prime without the flag to seed.

- When `GLOSSARY_TERMS > 0`, report coverage instead:

 > GLOSSARY.md: [N] terms — canonical vocabulary available to interview / plan / audit. No action; pruning belongs to `/flow-next:audit`.

DC8 is informational like DE7, but its remediation path differs: it is handled exclusively by the Phase 5.5 bootstrap (read-back gated), never as a Phase 5 question option.

## Production Readiness Notes

[Key observations from Pillars 6-8 that the team should be aware of]
```

**If `--report-only`**: Stop here. Show report and exit.

---

## Phase 5: Interactive Remediation

**If `--fix-all`**: Skip the questions below and continue at Phase 5.5 (the glossary bootstrap keeps its read-back gate even under `--fix-all`); Phase 6 then applies all recommendations from Pillars 1-5.

**CRITICAL**: For consent, you MUST ask via the plain-text numbered prompt described below.

**Ask the user via plain text.** Render the options below as a numbered list `1.` … `N.`, followed by a final option `N+1. Other — type your own answer`. Print the question, then the numbered list, then **stop and wait for the user's next message before continuing**. Parse the reply as: a bare number `1`–`N+1` → that option; the literal text of an option label → that option; free text after `Other` → custom answer.

### Using plain-text numbered prompt correctly

Each question should:
- Have a clear header (max 12 chars)
- Explain what each option does and WHY it helps agents
- Allow multi-select when options are not exclusive — number the options as `1.` … `N.` and ask the user to reply with the numbers (or labels) of all that apply
- Include impact description for each option

### Question Structure

Ask ONE question per category that has recommendations. Skip categories with no gaps.

**Question 1: Documentation (if gaps exist)**

```json
{
 "questions": [{
 "question": "Which documentation improvements should I create? These help agents understand your project without guessing.",
 "header": "Docs",
 "multiSelect": true,
 "options": [
 {
 "label": "Create CLAUDE.md (Recommended)",
 "description": "Agent instruction file with commands, conventions, and project structure. Critical for agents to work effectively."
 },
 {
 "label": "Create .env.example",
 "description": "Template with [N] detected env vars. Prevents agents from guessing required configuration."
 }
 ]
 }]
}
```

**Question 2: Tooling (if gaps exist)**

```json
{
 "questions": [{
 "question": "Which tooling improvements should I add? These give agents instant feedback instead of waiting for CI.",
 "header": "Tooling",
 "multiSelect": true,
 "options": [
 {
 "label": "Add pre-commit hooks (Recommended)",
 "description": "Husky + lint-staged for instant lint/format feedback. Catches errors in 5 seconds instead of 10 minutes."
 },
 {
 "label": "Add linter config",
 "description": "[Tool] configuration for code quality checks. Agents can run lint to verify their changes."
 },
 {
 "label": "Add formatter config",
 "description": "[Tool] configuration for consistent code style. Prevents style drift across agent sessions."
 },
 {
 "label": "Add runtime version file",
 "description": "Pin [runtime] version. Ensures consistent environment across machines."
 }
 ]
 }]
}
```

**Question 3: Testing (if gaps exist)**

```json
{
 "questions": [{
 "question": "Which testing improvements should I add? These let agents verify their work.",
 "header": "Testing",
 "multiSelect": true,
 "options": [
 {
 "label": "Add test config (Recommended)",
 "description": "[Framework] configuration file. Enables test command for agents to verify changes."
 },
 {
 "label": "Add test script",
 "description": "Adds 'test' command that agents can discover and run."
 }
 ]
 }]
}
```

**Question 4: Environment (if gaps exist)**

```json
{
 "questions": [{
 "question": "Which environment improvements should I add?",
 "header": "Environment",
 "multiSelect": true,
 "options": [
 {
 "label": "Add .gitignore entries (Recommended)",
 "description": "Ignore .env, build outputs, node_modules. Prevents accidental commits of sensitive data."
 },
 {
 "label": "Create devcontainer (Bonus)",
 "description": "VS Code devcontainer config for reproducible environment. Nice-to-have, not essential for agents."
 }
 ]
 }]
}
```

### Rules for Questions

1. **MUST ask via the plain-text numbered prompt described below**
2. **Mark recommended items** — Add "(Recommended)" to high-impact options
3. **Mark bonus items** — Add "(Bonus)" to nice-to-have options
4. **Explain agent benefit** — Each description should say WHY it helps agents
5. **Skip empty categories** — Don't ask if no recommendations
6. **Max 4 options per question** — Tool limit, prioritize if more
7. **Never offer Pillar 6-8 items** — Production readiness is informational only
8. **Never offer informational sub-criteria (DC7, DE7)** — Surface as suggestions in Top Recommendations only; no auto-run from Phase 5
9. **Never offer DC8 (glossary) as a Phase 5 option** — Its remediation is the dedicated Phase 5.5 bootstrap with its own read-back; a Phase 5 checkbox would bypass the never-write-terms-unseen gate

---

## Phase 5.5: Glossary Bootstrap (DC8)

Runs only when the Phase 3 glossary signal reported `GLOSSARY_TERMS == 0` (GLOSSARY.md absent or husk). When `GLOSSARY_TERMS > 0`, skip this phase entirely — prime never rewrites a populated glossary and never re-proposes existing terms; staleness/alias pruning belongs to `/flow-next:audit`.

`--fix-all` does NOT bypass the read-back below: term definitions are judgment-bearing canonical vocabulary, not mechanical templates — never write terms unseen. (`--report-only` never reaches this phase; the workflow stops at Phase 4.)

### 5.5.1 Scan for load-bearing vocabulary

Build the candidate pool from what Phase 1 already collected plus targeted reads:

- README.md, docs/, CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md (agents-md-scout and docs-gap-scout findings already summarize these — reuse them, don't re-read wholesale)
- Top-level module / package / directory names
- Domain nouns recurring across `.flow/specs/*.md` and source files
- Places where the SAME concept goes by two names in the repo (naming drift → `_Avoid_` candidates)

Selection bar: a term earns a slot when an agent could plausibly build around the wrong meaning — project-specific nouns, flows, and distinctions (e.g. two near-synonyms that mean different things in THIS repo). Exclude generic programming vocabulary (server, test, build) and anything without file evidence.

### 5.5.2 Propose terms

Draft ~10-20 candidates (fewer is fine for small repos — never pad). Each proposal carries:

- **Term** — canonical name
- **Definition** — 1-3 sentences, concrete, written against the code (not aspirational)
- **Evidence** — at least one file ref (`path` or `path:line`) where the concept lives; a term with no evidence is dropped, not guessed
- **`_Avoid_` aliases** (optional) — only where naming drift is visible in the repo
- **`_Relates to_`** (optional) — cross-references between proposed terms

### 5.5.3 Read-back (mandatory — never write unseen)

Present the FULL proposal — every term with its definition, evidence, and aliases — then ask via `plain-text numbered prompt`:

- **Approve all** — write every proposed term
- **Select subset** — user indicates which terms to keep (follow up for the list)
- **Skip** — write nothing

No write happens before this approval. Decline/skip ⇒ DC8 stays ❌, note it in the Phase 7 summary, move on — never re-ask in the same run.

### 5.5.4 Write accepted terms

One `flowctl glossary add` per accepted term — stdin definition so multi-sentence text round-trips cleanly (same call shape as interview's doc-aware write). `glossary add` creates `GLOSSARY.md` at the repo root when no ancestor file exists, and upserts on re-runs:

```bash
"$FLOWCTL" glossary add "<term>" --definition-file - --json <<'EOF'
<definition — 1-3 sentences>
EOF
# optional flags when proposed: --avoid "alt1,alt2" --relates-to "x,y"
```

Verify after the last write:

```bash
"$FLOWCTL" glossary list --json | jq -r '.total_terms' # must equal the accepted count
```

Record the outcome for Phase 7: seeded N terms / user declined / count mismatch (report it, don't retry-loop).

---

## Phase 6: Apply Fixes

For each approved fix:
1. Read [remediation.md](remediation.md) for the template
2. Detect project conventions (indent style, quote style, etc.)
3. Adapt template to match conventions
4. Check if target file exists:
 - **New file**: Create it
 - **Existing file**: Show diff and ask before modifying
5. Report what was created/modified

**Non-destructive rules:**
- Never overwrite without explicit consent
- Merge with existing configs when possible
- Use detected project style
- Don't add unused features
